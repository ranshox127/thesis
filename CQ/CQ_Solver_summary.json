                "content": "You are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity."

The first practical use of external combustion dates back to 1698, when Thomas Savery developed a steam-powered water pump. Steam engines were then perfected in the late 1700s by James Watt, and went on to fuel one of the most momentous technological leaps in human history during the Industrial Revolution . Throughout the 1800s external combustion allowed for exponential improvement in transportation, agriculture and manufacturing, and also powered the rise of world superpowers like Great Britain and the United States. Most important of all, the steam engine’s basic principle of energy-into-motion set the stage for later innovations like internal combustion engines and jet turbines, which prompted the rise of cars and aircraft during the 20th century.'}, {'title': 'Past and Present Technologies that Shaped Us and the World', 'url': 'https://unixsurplus.com/article/past-and-present-technologies-that-shaped-us-and-the-world/', 'content': \"Technological innovations have always been a matter of something in the past that’s learned to walk first so that the current advancements we enjoy at present could learn how to run. Or fly for that matter. Regardless of their purpose, both past and present technologies have significantly transformed human history, whether that be in a good or bad way. This article is a nod to the impact of the latest technologies we have seen and experienced throughout the years, to those who have instigated their creation, and as a testament to the sheer ferocity of humanity’s desire to better themselves with discovery and as answers to our own curiosity. Innovations Through the Years 1440: The Printing Press 1440 was when the invention that began the Printing Revolution came to be. The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg this year. It drastically enhanced the way knowledge spread by allowing books to be mass produced. Texts became more accessible to the general populace, thereby creating a more informed society. Historical inventions and their impact on society included democratized knowledge that enhanced literacy rates across Europe and inspired significant cultural movements, including the Renaissance and the Reformation. However, the printing press also facilitated the spread of extremist ideologies, contributing to social unrest and conflict, including religious wars and revolts. 1712: The Steam Engine The first commercially successful steam engine was developed by Thomas Newcomen in the year 1712 that ushered in the Industrial Revolution. James Watt built upon this innovation to introduce efficiency improvements in 1765. These enabled factories to be powered by steam engines for mass manufacturing and the growth of factories. Urbanization ran rampant as the economy shifted away from agrarian societies. That also meant air pollution in urban areas increased due to increased industrialization. 1832: The Electric Motor The first direct current electric motor was invented this year by William Sturgeon. This historical invention enabled the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy, changing the course of industrial automation. Electric motors have since powered everything from household appliances to large machinery. Their invention increased productivity and encouraged the growth of a wide array of industries. 1833-1871: The Computer The Analytical Engine was conceptualized during this time. It became the origin of the electronic computer as we know it today. Charles Babbage's innovation revolutionized information processing and drastically altered communication methods, work practices, and leisure activities. This innovation ushered in what is now known as the information age. However, the widespread use of computers has resulted in addiction, increased social isolation, and privacy concerns in present years. 1876: The Telephone Alexander Graham Bell during this year received his first patent for the telephone. The invention revolutionized communication by enabling instant voice transmission over distances. This drastically changed social interactions and business practices. The increased use of telephones in the years following also led to the development of telecommunication networks on a global scale 1879/1880: The Electric Light The light bulb was invented. This advanced tech innovation transformed lighting and was one of the greatest contributors to industrial growth. Thomas Edison patented it the previous year and began commercializing it in 1880. With this, not only the workspace but households transformed. It likewise impacted urban development, allowing cities to thrive after dark and influencing various industries reliant on electric power. 1885: The Automobile The first modern automobile was developed by Karl Benz. This invention provided a new level of personal mobility that reshaped urban landscapes. Not only that, but the existence of the automobile prompted the development of road networks and industries such as oil and rubber. The social implications were vast as changes such as suburbanization and shifting consumer behavior began to visibly reshape national economies at this juncture of history. This also came with increased pollution which was worse for the environment. 1903: The Airplane The Wright brothers achieved the first controlled powered flight which marked a pivotal moment in transportation history. This advancement revolutionized personal and commercial travel that reduced travel time across great distances. This likewise laid the groundwork for the modern aviation industry that enhanced global exchange. Though that also meant the invention of the airplane could likewise be used in other pursuits such as warfare. 1931: The Air Conditioner Schultz and Sherman invented the first room air conditioner. This technology transformed indoor living and working conditions. It helped ease the effects of heat and humidity that increased comfort and productivity in homes and workplaces. The introduction of air conditioning has also altered urban development and social patterns in areas with extreme climates. 1946: The Microwave Oven The microwave oven was initially invented for commercial use. It evolved to become a household staple in the years to come and quickly changed cooking and food preparation methods. Food can now be cooked rapidly without the need for traditional heating and revolutionized meal preparation. Despite the benefits, concerns about uneven cooking and nutrient retention persist, leading to ongoing research and development in microwave technology to this day. 1947: The Transistor The point-contact transistor was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain in December 1947. This innovation replaced vacuum tubes and changed electronics forever. Its small size and efficiency facilitated the miniaturization of electronic devices. This in turn led to the development of the various technologies that we use today. The transistor significantly impacted telecommunications and computing which gave rise to modern servers and supercomputers. Brands like Dell and Supermicro would not exist today without this innovation. 1947-1950s: Nuclear Power The exploration for peaceful uses of atomic energy began in 1947 and ramped up during the 1950s. Nuclear power emerged as a new energy source with significant implications for various sectors. One particular point in history was when Enrico Fermi initiated the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in 1942. This technology provided a new source of energy. Despite this, nuclear power still raised concerns regarding safety alongside political implications. There is a risk of catastrophic accidents and the long-term challenge of radioactive waste management. Another is the known mass casualties and long-lasting health effects due to radiation exposure. 1958: The Spacecraft Explorer 1 was the first U.S. satellite launched in January of 1958 which marked a major milestone in the history of space exploration. It was the first satellite to successfully collect and transmit scientific data about cosmic rays which led to the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts. This launch started generations of space exploration and paved the way for advances in science, technology, and satellite communications. There is a negative effect. The increase in spacecraft and satellites led to the accumulation of space debris that to this day poses risks to other orbiting objects and the environment. 1973: The GPS The United States Department of Defense initiated the Global Positioning System (GPS) project in 1973, with the first prototype satellite launched in 1978. This technology transformed navigation across various applications as the GPS revolutionized navigation and location tracking globally. As one of the best examples of current technological advances, GPS technology has transformed various industries and enhanced capabilities in logistics, transportation, and mapping. The innovation also contributed to personal navigation systems used in cars and smartphones. 2009: Blockchain Technology Satoshi Nakamoto introduced blockchain technology through the invention of Bitcoin in 2008. This distributed technology challenged traditional financial systems. Its applications extend beyond cryptocurrencies to include supply chain management, healthcare, and digital voting, significantly impacting how data is managed globally. However, it also opened multiple avenues for exploitation. 2010s: CRISPR Technology CRISPR technology in 1987 was utilized for gene editing in the 2010s. It was a groundbreaking advancement in medical research that enabled precise gene editing. Its ability to edit DNA has revolutionized biotechnology that advanced agriculture, medicine, and other such sectors. Ethical considerations surrounding its use, particularly regarding human embryos, prompt ongoing debates about genetic modification however, making it one of the most questionable of past and present technologies in history. Gene-editing technologies are believed to reduce diversity in populations and threaten the natural variation that characterizes us as humans. 2010s Onwards: Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence's evolution has roots dating back to the 1950s with recent developments driving innovations across various sectors. Early milestones included the development of computer algorithms capable of learning from data. Today, AI influences various sectors, including healthcare and finance, driving innovations that reshape industries and fundamentally alter human-computer interactions. AI's integration into society is also seen as a possible source of job and privacy loss. People debate that AI has the potential for biased decision-making based on flawed data. The Price of Innovation and a Note to the Future This stunning list is something we should take pride in. It only goes to show how both technologies past and present have led humanity to advance by leaps and bounds. Yet we can also not deny the extensive repercussions that resulted from such discoveries. With each technological advancement, a mixture of benefits and challenges that influence various aspects of society is likewise triggered. Some as consequences to greedy actions. We don’t say however that exploration of technological innovations should be ceased completely. UNIXSurplus supports furthering this aspect of life which often unveils a fascinating tapestry of transformative benefits for everyone. It just pays to remind ourselves that progress often comes with its own set of drawbacks and that we should remain vigilant in addressing them. To always harness the power of technology to shape a brighter future for all. Embracing these innovations with both enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility will empower us to unlock unprecedented possibilities for generations more to come.

Today, social networking sites are the preferred platforms for all kinds of activities, both business and personal, and sociability has dramatically increased — but it is a different kind of sociability. Most Facebook users visit the site daily, and they connect on multiple dimensions, but only on the dimensions they choose. The virtual life is becoming more social than the physical life, but it is less a virtual reality than a real virtuality, facilitating real-life work and urban living. Because people are increasingly at ease in the Web’s multidimensionality, marketers, government, and civil society are migrating massively to the networks people construct by themselves and for themselves. At root, social-networking entrepreneurs are really selling spaces in which people can freely and autonomously construct their lives. Sites that attempt to impede free communication are soon abandoned by many users in favor of friendlier and less restricted spaces. Perhaps the most telling expression of this new freedom is the Internet’s transformation of sociopolitical practices. Messages no longer flow solely from the few to the many, with little interactivity. Now, messages also flow from the many to the many, multimodally and interactively. By disintermediating government and corporate control of communication, horizontal communication networks have created a new landscape of social and political change. Networked social movements have been particularly active since 2010, notably in the Arab revolutions against dictatorships and the protests against the management of the financial crisis. Online and particularly wireless communication has helped social movements pose more of a challenge to state power. The Internet and the Web constitute the technological infrastructure of the global network society, and the understanding of their logic is a key field of research. It is only scholarly research that will enable us to cut through the myths surrounding this digital communication technology that is already a second skin for young people, yet continues to feed the fears and the fantasies of those who are still in charge of a society that they barely understand.

The introduction of the internet marks a massive paradigm shift, much like the invention of the steam engine, which fundamentally altered the course of human history. With over 5.3 billion users worldwide , representing 66% of the global population, the internet’s impact is vast and multifaceted. From transforming the global economy and social interactions to offering access to endless information, the internet has become a cornerstone of our lives. However, it also brought new challenges, including privacy concerns, the digital divide, and the spread of misinformation. Join us to learn how the internet continues influencing our world, offering a comprehensive look at its benefits and complexities. 1. The Internet Has Made Everyday Life Simple The internet has made many daily tasks easier and more efficient: Online shopping, from groceries to travel tickets, gets you what you need without leaving home. Google Maps has revolutionized how we find our way in unfamiliar places. Real-time language translation through Google Translate breaks down communication barriers. Scheduling appointments, from doctor visits to salon bookings, is now just a few clicks away. Streaming platforms provide immediate access to TV shows and movies, changing media consumption. Online banking and digital payment services simplify financial transactions. Email and instant messaging have replaced traditional postal services. But while the internet has simplified many aspects of life, it has also introduced new layers of complexity. The sheer volume of information and options can sometimes feel overwhelming, and the pace of digital communication demands constant connectivity and responsiveness. Cultural Impact and Globalization The internet has accelerated globalization, introducing foreign cultures into local contexts. This exposure has sometimes supplanted traditional norms and values, sparking debates about cultural preservation in the digital age . On the flip side, the internet facilitates the fast sharing of cultural products and practices, promoting a greater understanding and appreciation of global diversity. 2. Business Moved Online En Masse In 1998, Shikhar Ghosh noted, “[The internet] will unquestionably affect every company’s relationship with its customers and the value propositions for many companies.” This observation began a significant shift as businesses raced to establish their online presence. Those who adapted swiftly reaped the benefits of a global market and transformed customer relationships. The rush to go online nearly eradicated traditional business models. E-commerce platforms like Etsy and Shopify empowered small businesses to reach global audiences. For example, a small jewelry business traditionally serving a local customer base can now sell its products worldwide through an online store. The growth of online sales, accounting for 15.6% of US retail and projected to reach $1.319 billion by 2028 , is a testament to how the internet changed consumer behavior and business strategies. Here are essential ways in which the internet has changed work and business communication , according to Vonage : Global reach : Businesses are now open to more than their local customer base but can attract a worldwide audience, intensifying competition and expanding opportunities. Real-time communication : Tools like live chat, messaging apps, and video meetings enable immediate global communication with employees and clients. Remote work : The pandemic accelerated the shift to remote and hybrid work models, reducing overhead costs and introducing flexible work arrangements. Digital marketing expansion : Internet marketing requires businesses to stay attuned to customer needs, using digital advertising to reach potential clients across the globe. Enhanced collaboration : The internet has made collaborating with other businesses and professionals simpler, with webinars and online projects enabling knowledge sharing on a global scale. Additionally, the internet has given rise to the gig economy , offering flexibility and freedom for freelancers and digital nomads. Yet, it also poses challenges, such as job insecurity and the blurring of work-life boundaries. 3. The Social Media Redefined Human Connection Humans are inherently social creatures, yet the internet has fundamentally altered our interactions. We are now in unchartered sociological waters; social media platforms have evolved from simple communication channels to places that shape and influence public discourse. As of 2020, social media usage reached an astounding 5.17 billion people globally . Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have democratized content creation, allowing users to share their lives and views, fostering empowerment. Yet, this empowerment comes at a cost. As Yuval Noah Harari’s “Stolen Focus” articulates, “the constant barrage of notifications and the allure of endless scrolling compromise our attention spans and well-being, highlighting a pervasive sense of digital fatigue and alienation.” Studies and anecdotal evidence suggest a paradoxical effect: as our online networks expand, the depth of our offline relationships can suffer. The convenience of digital interaction sometimes replaces the intimacy of face-to-face conversations, leading to a nuanced landscape of socialization where the lines between connection and isolation blur. Social Media & Political Mobilization On the other hand, social media has become an effective tool in political mobilization. Its power to unite voices across geographical divides was vividly demonstrated during the Arab Spring. Platforms became catalysts for political mobilization , enabling protesters to organize and disseminate their cause worldwide. Similarly, movements like #MeToo have leveraged social media’s reach to challenge societal norms and demand change. 4. Learning and Education Became Accessible to All Before the widespread adoption of the internet, we were already stepping into the Information Age. Still, today, we find ourselves fully immersed in its depths. The internet lets us access infinite information, much like an open digital library. Consequently, we’ve democratized learning , allowing virtually anyone to gain knowledge from any corner of the world with an internet connection. Here’s how the internet changed education: The internet has democratized access to information, breaking down barriers that restricted knowledge to specific geographical locations. Research papers, academic journals, and vast knowledge libraries are now available to anyone with an internet connection. Learning new skills has become more accessible and diverse. From watching a sushi master on YouTube to taking online courses on coding or language learning, the opportunities for personal growth are boundless. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet significantly enhanced education. Schools closed, but anyone with a laptop and reliable internet access could continue their education. The Digital Divide Highlights New Challenges However, despite the abundance of resources, a significant disparity remains in digital access. Termed the “digital divide,” this gap separates individuals with readily available internet access from those without. The lack of internet access equates to missed opportunities in education, employment, and social engagement, underscoring the urgency of initiatives to extend connectivity to remote areas and provide digital skills training to underserved populations. The Spread of Misinformation and Fake News However, the ease of accessing and disseminating information comes with challenges, particularly spreading misinformation and disinformation . Social media has become a fertile ground for fake news , with studies indicating that misinformation spreads up to 10 times faster than accurate reporting . So, while the internet has positively democratized information access, we should also learn to discern information responsibly. Moving forward, tech companies, fact-checkers, and educators need to promote media literacy and critical thinking skills . 5. Technology Boosts Innovation at Breakneck Speed The internet itself has long been a catalyst for innovation. Its ability to connect people globally and provide access to vast information has laid the groundwork for many of the technological advancements we see today. The internet’s evolution, notably with the impending rollout of 10G networks , catalyzes innovation across various technological fronts. These advancements promise to reshape our daily lives and the broader societal landscape Technological breakthroughs AI (Artificial Intelligence) enhances data analysis, personalizes services, and automates tasks previously needing human intervention. Blockchain offers secure, transparent transactions without intermediaries, revolutionizing data management and financial transactions. Cloud Computing enables scalable, on-demand access to computing resources, facilitating remote work, data storage, and application use. Automation and smart home technologies transform living spaces into interconnected, efficient homes where devices communicate and operate with minimal human input These technologies present challenges, including cybersecurity risks and job market disruptions. For example, the World Economic Forum reported that AI might replace approximately 85 million jobs by 2025. Additionally, environmental considerations , such as the energy consumption of data centers and electronic waste, urge sustainable practices in tech development and usage 6. Privacy and Security Became Central Concern As the internet continues to change the world, the concepts of privacy and security have taken on a whole new meaning. Since we share so much personal information online, our digital privacy and security risks are greater than ever. The need for strong online protection extends beyond creating strong passwords or steering clear of phishing emails . It encompasses a deeper understanding of the value of our data and an awareness of our rights to privacy. The ethical handling of this data by companies and governments is paramount. Yet, the sheer volume of information complicates these responsibilities For example, the Cambridge Analytica Scandal is a stark reminder of the potential misuse of personal data. The unauthorized access and use of millions of Facebook users’ data for political campaigning highlighted the urgent need for stronger data protection measures and ethical standards Key Privacy Initiatives and Legislatio Luckily, several significant initiatives have already been established to enhance data protection and privacy: GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) : Implemented by the European Union, the GDPR set strict guidelines for handling personal data. It mandates transparency from companies about their data practices. It empowers individuals with the right to understand and control their digital footprint. CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) : Enacted in 2019, it represents the first major privacy legislation in the United States, focusing on providing consumers insight and control over the use of their personal data. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD) enhances privacy protections and mirrors the GDPR’s approach. The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada sets the standard for data privacy, regulating how private sector organizations collect, use, and disclose personal information. A secure digital environment requires constant vigilance, informed awareness, and active participation in protecting our digital selves in an ever-evolving landscape. 7. Governance and Policy Adapted to the Digital Ag The internet changed governance and public policy, challenging existing models and introducing new avenues for civic engagement. Digital policy is a critical area of focus, encompassing issues such as net neutrality, digital rights, and the necessity for international cooperation to manage cyberspace Key developments in internet governance Net Neutrality advocates for treating all internet data equally, preventing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from discriminating against or charging differently by user, content, website, or platform. It’s a cornerstone for maintaining the internet as an open and democratic platform, fostering innovation and safeguarding freedom of expression. Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) : Recognizing the internet as a vital resource, initiatives like the ACP aim to reduce the digital divide by providing discounted internet access to low-income households. This program was part of a broader effort to ensure equitable internet access but was discontinued in early 2024. Digital Voting and Civic Participation is in its nascent stages in many countries. They represent a shift towards more accessible and inclusive democratic processes, allowing citizens to engage in governance directly from their digital devices As we progress, policymakers, service providers, and users should work together to ensure the internet serves the common good. That way, the internet can remain a global forum where knowledge, ideas, and democratic discourse can flourish Final Thoughts on How Has the Internet Changed the World The internet’s impact is huge, from connecting us globally to changing how we learn, work, and stay informed. But with great power comes great responsibility, and it’s up to us to use the internet in ways that help rather than harm In that light, ISPs are not just providers but educators and protectors of responsible internet usage. Race Communications is an excellent example of this change. We focus giving internet access and keeping our subscribers safe and teaching them how to avoid dangers online. For example, our mobile app Race CommandIQ automatically blocks threats, and we share detailed guides to help them navigate the internet safely.'}, {'title': 'The impact of technological advancement on culture and society', 'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-83995-z', 'content': 'The findings of this research underscore the profound and multifaceted impacts of technological advancements on cultural practices, identities and societal structures. The interplay of globalization, digital transformation and the rise of cybercultures has redefined traditional notions of identity, cultural exchange and community, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Globalization and cultural hybridization Globalization, propelled by technological advancements, has significantly altered the dynamics of cultural interaction and exchange. Advanced communication technologies and digital platforms have facilitated unprecedented cross-border cultural integration, enabling the blending of indigenous traditions with global influences. This hybridization has led to the emergence of unique cultural expressions, particularly in areas like music, fashion and cuisine. For instance, traditional culinary practices have been adapted to incorporate global ingredients and techniques, creating fusion cuisines that resonate with diverse audiences. However, the rapid pace of cultural exchange has not been without challenges. The dominance of culturally powerful nations, often mediated through technology, has led to the marginalization of less dominant cultural practices. Cultural homogenization—the loss of unique local traditions in favor of mainstream, globalized norms—is a recurring concern. Social media platforms, while serving as tools for cultural expression, often amplify hegemonic narratives, overshadowing indigenous voices and traditions. The actor-network theory provides a framework for understanding how technology acts as both a tool and an active agent in these cultural transformations. By enabling new forms of social and cultural interactions, technological networks disrupt traditional hierarchies and create spaces for innovation. Media archaeology further contextualizes these changes, revealing how current technological shifts mirror historical patterns of cultural adaptation, thus offering insights into the cyclical nature of cultural evolution 11 . Technology’s impact on identity and tradition Technological innovations have reshaped how individuals and communities engage with cultural traditions and construct identities. The integration of digital tools into everyday life has democratized access to cultural knowledge, enabling broader participation in cultural preservation and expression. Digital platforms allow marginalized communities to share their narratives and traditions with a global audience, challenging traditional gatekeepers of cultural authority. However, this democratization comes with its own set of challenges. The authenticity of cultural practices is often questioned as traditions are adapted for digital representation. The commercialization of cultural symbols, particularly indigenous artifacts, raises ethical concerns about appropriation and the commodification of heritage. For example, traditional handicrafts and rituals, once deeply embedded in specific cultural contexts, are now reproduced and marketed globally, often stripped of their original meaning 12 . The increasing virtualization of cultural experiences has also led to a redefinition of cultural boundaries. Virtual museums, online archives and digital storytelling platforms have made cultural artifacts more accessible but have also detached them from their physical and contextual origins. This shift has sparked debates about the role of technology in preserving cultural integrity versus enabling superficial engagements. Cybercultures and the rise of digital communities The digital age has given rise to cybercultures communities and identities formed in virtual spaces. These cultures transcend geographical and temporal boundaries, creating new forms of interaction and belonging. Online gaming environments, social media platforms and virtual reality spaces have become hubs for the development of subcultures with distinct languages, symbols and norms. For example, multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft have fostered “guilds” virtual communities with shared goals, governance structures and cultural practices. These communities exemplify how technology facilitates the creation of cohesive social groups, even without physical proximity. Similarly, social media platforms have enabled the formation of niche communities centered around shared interests, from art and music to social activism 13 , 14 . Despite their potential for fostering inclusivity and innovation, cybercultures are not immune to the replication of real-world inequalities. Issues of gender, race and socioeconomic disparities often persist in virtual spaces, reflecting broader societal challenges. Additionally, the commercialization and corporatization of digital platforms have raised concerns about the erosion of alternative cultural expressions. The dominance of corporate interests in shaping online interactions risks flattening the diversity of cybercultures, privileging mainstream narratives over grassroots movements. Preservation and transformation of cultural practices One of the most significant impacts of technology on culture has been its dual role in preserving and transforming cultural practices. On one hand, digital technologies have enabled the documentation and dissemination of endangered traditions, ensuring their survival for future generations. Virtual reality reconstructions of historical sites, digitized manuscripts, and online repositories of oral histories are examples of how technology has become a powerful tool for cultural preservation. On the other hand, the process of digitization often necessitates adaptation, leading to the transformation of cultural practices. Traditional festivals, for instance, are increasingly celebrated in virtual spaces, accommodating participants from around the world. While this shift expands accessibility, it also alters the nature of the experience, raising questions about the authenticity and essence of cultural rituals. The interplay between preservation and transformation highlights the complexity of cultural adaptation in the digital age. Technologies that aim to safeguard traditions must navigate the delicate balance between maintaining authenticity and embracing innovation. Ethical implications and power dynamics The integration of technology into cultural practices has profound ethical implications, particularly concerning issues of power and representation. The digital divide, inequities in access to technology, exacerbates existing cultural and social disparities. Marginalized communities often face barriers to accessing digital tools, limiting their ability to participate in and benefit from technological advancements. Moreover, the global dissemination of cultural content through digital platforms often reflects asymmetrical power dynamics. Western and corporate values dominate these platforms, shaping global cultural narratives and perpetuating cultural hegemony. This dominance marginalizes alternative perspectives and reinforces existing inequalities. Critical theories, such as those proposed by the Frankfurt School, provide a lens for examining these power dynamics. By interrogating the commodification of culture and the role of technology in perpetuating societal hierarchies, these theories underscore the need for more inclusive and equitable approaches to technological development and cultural representation. The findings of this research point to the need for a nuanced and culturally sensitive approach to managing the relationship between technology and culture. Policymakers, technologists and cultural practitioners must collaborate to develop strategies that promote cultural diversity and inclusivity while addressing the challenges posed by technological integration. We can recommend the following: Enhancing digital literacy: providing education and resources to empower individuals and communities to engage with technology critically and creatively Promoting ethical practices: establishing guidelines to prevent cultural appropriation and ensure the respectful representation of traditions in digital spaces Fostering inclusivity: designing technologies that prioritize the needs and perspectives of underrepresented groups, ensuring equitable access and participation Encouraging cross-cultural collaboration: leveraging technology to facilitate meaningful exchanges between diverse cultural groups, fostering mutual understanding and appreciation'}]"

This could enrich the comparison and deepen the analysis.\n\n3. **Confidence Assessment**: With the current depth provided by the annotations under each sub-question, I am confident that the main question has been sufficiently addressed in terms of identifying and comparing rapid societal transformations due to technology.\n\nBased on these reflections, I will proceed to provide a final answer."

Since its inception, the internet has profoundly democratised access to information, enabled instantaneous global connectivity, and transformed social interactions, business models, and traditional industries. Platforms like social media have redefined personal and political mobilization and activism, leading to swift socio-political changes.\n\nComparatively, while technologies like the steam engine and electricity took decades to integrate and effect visible changes in societal norms and structures, the internet's impact has been far more rapid, heavily influencing global economics, politics, and culture within just a few decades. This rapid integration and pervasive influence mark the internet's impact as arguably one of the most profound and swift transformations in history."

                "content": "You are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity."

More however, there are multiple factors at play that can influence your salary potential. getty The project management industry is witnessing unprecedented growth, and is set to increase in demand over the next few years, with a predicted 25 million needed to fill the gap across various industries globally. Some of the most popular sectors with opportunities for project managers include technology, construction, manufacturing, and finance. This comes at a time when the technology sector is booming, with AI spurring the need for over 90 million new jobs . It turns out that roles requiring project management skills and capabilities such as people management, stakeholder management and engagement, budgeting, project planning, and resource management are becoming more of a necessity for most organizations. And in tandem with this demand, the median salary for project practitioners in the U.S. is $120,000, up from $115,000 in 2021, according to the Project Management Institute's (PMI) findings . Which Countries Offer The Highest Salaries For Project Managers? According to PMI's report, the U.S., Australia, Germany, United Kingdom, and Singapore turn out to be in the list of the top five countries offering the most promising salaries for PM professionals. The rate of increase dramatically varies across countries, however, with Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and The United Arab Emirates, witnessing increases of more than 60%. But living and working in the right country is only part of the answer. As a general rule, you need to fulfill a few key criteria before you can expect to make six figures in this profession. Some of the other factors that affect your salary are outlined below: Factors That Influence Earning Potential To build and continue to grow your career as a project manager, you need to first bear in mind that a continuous growth mindset is key to your career success. Any management profession demands some aspect of PM skills, but if you are working specifically as a project manager, you will be expected to be versatile, adapt, plan for the worst, and coordinate multiple aspects while keeping projects or programs running smoothly. In our technically enhanced economy, you'll need to work on adopting new skill sets , such as proficiency in emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, automation, and data analytics. Therefore, ongoing industry awareness is key to your career success and salary increase. Continuous learning So it's no wonder that continuous learning and development, specifically for project management practice, played a key role in influencing some of the highest wage earners surveyed by PMI, who reported that obtaining a PMP certification helped them earn more in their roles. Some other project management certifications you can obtain include Prince2 Foundation and Practitioner, Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), and Six Sigma Green Belt and Black Belt. Project size and sector The scope and budget of a project, and the type of sector you're operating in, can significantly impact earning potential. For example, a multi-million-dollar government project would pay significantly more than a nonprofit working with a half-million-dollar budget. Experience The number of years of experience you have in project management is a directly contributing factor to your earning potential. As you increase in years of experience, in project size, and in your qualifications, your pay will show for it.

Complete Salary Guide', 'url': 'https://project-management.com/project-manager-salary/', 'content': 'Project managers in the United States earn an average of $90,000 a year . Several factors impact project manager salary, including location, experience, and education. A project manager needs to acquire certain skills, like conflict resolution and time management, and earn certifications, such as the Project Management Professional (PMP), to enjoy higher compensation. Do project managers make good money? The answer depends on a variety of factors—including what your definition of good is. As of 2024, the average project manager salary in the United States is just under $90,000 per year. However, this is only the average. With some making under $58,000 per year and others making nearly $139,000 annually, there’s quite a bit of range to consider. There are a lot of variables affecting project manager salary, including the following: Geographic location (for remote workers, the location of their employer) Prior experience in the field of project management Prior education or training in the field of project management The industry you’re currently in How Much Do Project Managers Make? The average PM salary tends to vary greatly between industries, companies, and geographic regions. However, overall experience in project management also plays a significant role in determining salary. According to recent Payscale data on IT project manager salary , those with 20 years of project management experience in the IT industry can expect to make more than what a project manager with 10 years of experience earns. Here’s how Payscale places the average annual salary of those in IT project management based on tenure: Less than one year: $66,000 annually One to four years: $78,000 annually Five to nine years: $96,000 annually 10 to 19 years: $108,000 20+ years: $117,000 Project managers in other industries tend to make less. Based on the research conducted by Payscale on general project manager salary , here’s how much PMs in other industries outside of IT earn based on tenure: Less than one year: $61,000 annually One to four years: $71,000 annually Five to nine years: $84,000 annually 10 to 19 years: $94,000 annually 20+ years: $97,000 annually For those who tend to jump around from industry to industry or one company to another, the freelance project manager salary is comparable to the numbers listed above. Other roles in project management, such as the role of project coordinator , tend to pay slightly less. However, the industry isn’t the only factor to consider when determining remuneration. Factors That Affect PM Salary As mentioned, the average project management salary is affected by numerous factors. We’ve already covered how experience plays a major role when determining PM salary, but what about the other factors? Location Given the wide range in the average cost of living across the United States, it should come as no surprise that certain regions pay more than others. For example, a project management specialist working in the state of California is likely to make significantly more than one who is working in New Jersey. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , the top-paying metropolitan areas for project management specialists include: San Jose / Sunnyvale / Santa Clara, CA: $150,720 annual mean wage San Francisco / Oakland / Hayward, CA: $132,540 annual mean wage New York, NY / Newark, NJ: $128,810 annual mean wage Dothan, AL: $128,420 annual mean wage Casper, WY: 128,280 annual mean wage Seattle / Tacoma / Bellevue, WA: $125,390 annual mean wage Boulder, CO: $117,840 annual mean wage Based on this data, it is clear that geographic location plays a huge role in determining how much project managers make. Generally speaking, PMs on the west coast of the US make more than their counterparts on the east coast or within the midwest. However, there are some exceptions, especially when it comes to major metropolitan areas. Education A project manager’s academic background also has a significant impact on their overall salary. In fact, many roles in project management require at least a bachelor’s degree in a related field. Some highly technical or niche project management roles might even require a specific degree, such as a bachelor’s or master’s in engineering or information technology. According to Coursera , project management salaries tend to increase significantly along with the degree level. Bachelor’s degree from a four-year program: $99,138 Master’s degree: $109,564 Doctoral degree: $114,985 It’s important to note that these numbers represent the average salary for a project manager in the US. The exact salaries will also be subject to all of the other factors that normally affect pay, namely your location and industry. Industry Similar to location, the specific industry can also have a significant impact on project manager income. While a software project manager salary is approximately $95,904 or $46.11 per hour, PMs working in government only maintain an average salary of $69,237 or $33.29 per hour. According to Zippia, the eight highest-paying industries for project managers include: Information technology: $95,904 annually / $46.11 per hour Finance: $92,065 annually / $44.26 per hour Construction: $91,283 annually / $43.89 per hour Manufacturing: $90,196 annually / $43.36 per hour Professional: $89,400 annually / $42.98 per hour Retail: $89,041 annually / $42.81 per hour Telecommunications: $81,951 annually / $39.40 per hour Government: $69,237 annually / $33.29 per hour Those with knowledge of advanced concepts in IT, finance, construction, and manufacturing are often in high demand and, as such, get paid more. Project Size The overall project size or, more specifically, the total number of project team members, also affects project manager income. Since larger teams mean more people that need to be managed, it’s only natural that larger projects come with higher pay. In some cases, this could amount to an additional $25,000 per year when compared to PMs that oversee smaller teams and projects. According to the Project Management Institute (PMI) , median PM salaries based on overall team size within the US are: One to four team members: $106,888 annually Five to nine team members: $115,000 annually 10 to 14 team members: $121,533 annually 15 to 19 team members: $122,000 annually 20 or more team members: $130,000 annually While these numbers are tempting and may convince you to seek the largest projects you can find, keep in mind that projects with teams consisting of dozens of members are far more complicated than smaller projects with one or two members. As such, these roles are generally reserved for established PMs who already have years of hands-on experience in the role. Skills to Obtain Most PMs leverage a variety of project management skills on a day-to-day basis. That said, the best PMs are usually highly versatile and eager to learn new skills and concepts. In some cases, certain industries or companies might even require specific skill sets. But there are also some skills that are useful regardless of the industry you’re in or the company you work for. Communications Project managers need to be able to communicate effectively. As a project manager, not only will you need to communicate with your team members to monitor productivity and address any issues that may arise, but you also need to maintain contact with key stakeholders. As such, you will often have to go back-and-forth between communicating with subordinates and communicating with executive-level figureheads. Team Leadership Great PMs need to be effective team leaders. Part of your responsibility is to prioritize and delegate tasks, share constructive feedback with your team members, and if necessary, provide disciplinary actions to those who aren’t doing their part. Because of the nature of the position, project managers are also expected to be approachable, empathetic, and understanding of any potential issues. Time Management Modern project managers need to be excellent at managing time as well. Between overseeing project timelines, monitoring the day-to-day work of team members, and making sure project deliverables are completed on a timely basis, diligence and organization are considered key skills that can take you a long way if you are pursuing a career in project management . Conflict Resolution Although it’s best to keep conflicts at a minimum, there are some cases where they’re inevitable. Whether you’re settling personal differences between team members, addressing issues with organizational leadership, or trying to convince stakeholders of the value of a new project, you need to be able to facilitate a solution that is beneficial for everyone involved. More importantly, you need to achieve this without having a negative effect on the project as a whole. Risk Management Even the most meticulously planned and highly organized projects carry some amount of risk. Some of the most common project risks include: Performance risks Technological risks Operational risks External risks Scope creep As a PM, it’s essential that you know how to minimize these risks, and if they do occur, it’s even more important that you know how to address these issues in a timely manner. There are a lot of resources available that can help you learn more about risk management. Coursera’s project management course includes modules on risk assessment and management you can use to hone your skills. Attention to Detail PMs are highly detail-oriented individuals with stringent standards of quality. As a project manager, you need to keep track of the most important details and monitor every aspect of the work—from project timelines to completion of individual tasks. Losing track of key deadlines, for example, could result in extreme project delays that may be considered unacceptable in the eyes of key project stakeholders. Certifications to Get Apart from an academic degree, there are a plethora of project management certifications available to pursue. While some carry more weight than others, all of the accreditations listed below will look great on any PM’s resume. Moreover, they all have the potential for increased pay and benefits as part of your certified project manager salary. Project Management Professional (PMP) One of the most common certifications for mid- and senior-level project managers, the PMP designation is highly regarded by organizations around the world. There are strict requirements for taking the exam, including 36 months of experience for those with bachelor’s degrees or 60 months of experience for those with a high-school diploma or associate’s degree—which is why PMP is said to be not geared toward entry-level PMs. While the requirements are strict, the high salary that comes with having a PMP certificate is well worth the time and effort. Agile Certified Practitioner (ACP) The agile methodology includes a standardized set of frameworks, processes, and practices deemed ideal for managing large-scale projects. For those who already have a deep understanding of the agile methodology, the ACP is an incredibly valuable certification to obtain. PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) Project managers need to be good at managing risks. Not only do you need to forecast risks with some degree of certainty, but you also need to address unexpected issues as they arise. If you have demonstrated the ability to manage project risks, getting the RMP certification is one of the best ways to validate your skills and increase your project manager income. CompTIA Project+ Offered exclusively through CompTIA, the CompTIA Project+ certification is ideal for new and novice PMs. Whether you’re trying to get your foot in the door or you already have a couple years of project management experience under your belt, this accreditation will help you take your career to the next level. FAQ We’ve already gone into detail on the various factors affecting project manager salary, important skills to obtain, and different certifications to pursue. Here are other frequently asked questions you may find helpful. Bottom Line For those wondering how much project managers make, it’s important to remember that there is a wide range in current salaries. However, there are some steps you can take to increase the amount of value you bring to a company and, as a result, boost your project management salary. In some cases, this might be as simple as obtaining an advanced certification or degree in the field. Other times, you may be required to start with an entry-level role and climb your way up the ranks . Either way, the end result is always worth the time and effort.'}, {'title': '25 Million Project Managers In Demand As Median Salaries Soar ... - Forbes', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2023/11/10/25-million-project-managers-in-demand-as-median-salaries-soar-to-120k/', 'content': \"Project management professionals are in high demand, and these roles promise six-figure salaries; ...

Some of the most popular sectors with opportunities for project managers include technology, construction, manufacturing, and finance. This comes at a time when the technology sector is booming, with AI spurring the need for over 90 million new jobs .

And in tandem with this demand, the median salary for project practitioners in the U.S. is $120,000, up from $115,000 in 2021, according to the Project Management Institute's (PMI) findings . Which Countries Offer The Highest Salaries For Project Managers? According to PMI's report, the U.S., Australia, Germany, United Kingdom, and Singapore turn out to be in the list of the top five countries offering the most promising salaries for PM professionals. The rate of increase dramatically varies across countries, however, with Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and The United Arab Emirates, witnessing increases of more than 60%. But living and working in the right country is only part of the answer. As a general rule, you need to fulfill a few key criteria before you can expect to make six figures in this profession. Some of the other factors that affect your salary are outlined below: Factors That Influence Earning Potential To build and continue to grow your career as a project manager, you need to first bear in mind that a continuous growth mindset is key to your career success. Any management profession demands some aspect of PM skills, but if you are working specifically as a project manager, you will be expected to be versatile, adapt, plan for the worst, and coordinate multiple aspects while keeping projects or programs running smoothly. In our technically enhanced economy, you'll need to work on adopting new skill sets , such as proficiency in emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, automation, and data analytics. Therefore, ongoing industry awareness is key to your career success and salary increase. Continuous learning So it's no wonder that continuous learning and development, specifically for project management practice, played a key role in influencing some of the highest wage earners surveyed by PMI, who reported that obtaining a PMP certification helped them earn more in their roles. Some other project management certifications you can obtain include Prince2 Foundation and Practitioner, Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), and Six Sigma Green Belt and Black Belt. Project size and sector The scope and budget of a project, and the type of sector you're operating in, can significantly impact earning potential. For example, a multi-million-dollar government project would pay significantly more than a nonprofit working with a half-million-dollar budget. Experience The number of years of experience you have in project management is a directly contributing factor to your earning potential. As you increase in years of experience, in project size, and in your qualifications, your pay will show for it. For example, a project manager in the United States with less than three years of experience could make on average $78,279, while those with up to 10 years of experience can earn around $100,000 annually. While industries and sectors are evolving and demand increases for project managers in various capacities, this is the perfect time to jump into the industry if you haven't already.

Due to economic growth, the number of professionals in project-management-orientated employment needs to increase rapidly to keep up with demand and reach the forecasted number of 88 million by 2027. As a result of high demand, employers are swiftly trying to grow their project workforces, offering salaries that make the role ‘ financially attractive’ . But how much do those in the project management industry really earn? The Digital Project Manager conducted its annual salary survey to discover the typical and average wage for someone working in project management, from entry-level to senior roles and throughout the hierarchy. Over a 3-month period, 201 respondents working in project-related roles shared details on their experience, work set-up, type of contract, level of education, certification and most importantly, annual salary. Looking at results from a few well-known career sites (e.g., Indeed, Glassdoor, Salary Expert), the typical salary for project managers ranges from $82,670 on one site to $140,000 on another. The career sites’ listings average project manager salary in the US was estimated at $95,434 and the average for someone in a project-led role overall was $96,512. Meanwhile, the survey data revealed the average salary as $100,459. However, we combined data from our salary survey with the data from career sites to show a more accurate average salary of $100,238. While these figures include project manager salaries for multiple industries, the typical wage can be variable due to required skill sets or criteria. The highest recorded salary is from those in the Retail/Commerce industry ($227,143), followed by Software/IT ($100,544), Construction ($91,667), Finance, Banking and Insurance ($91,533), Healthcare ($90,759), Media, Marketing or Advertising ($81,602), Government, Public or Nonprofit ($79,563) and Telecomm ($76,667) industries. Moreover, data analysts also compared this year’s results with the survey data collected in 2020 to show and compare the salary increases or decreases over three years. The average salary for a project manager has increased by $23,827 since 2020, where the average was $76,632. One trend the survey typically demonstrates is the salary increase for those in senior roles. For example, Head of Project Management positions saw an average salary increase of $106,882 in 2020 to $165,795, while Senior Project Manager salaries rose from $97,452 to $120,549. Although, those in entry-level or junior positions have been less fortunate with salary increases, as the average salary for a Project Coordinator decreased from $54,394 in 2020 to $52,333. The decrease shows the increasing importance of experience and certification/professional qualification in the project management industry. According to the survey results, those with five to 10 years of experience or more in the project management industry can collect an average annual salary of $150,403, while those with three to five earned $93,861 on average, followed by $86,519 for one to three and $69,000 for less than one year. Digital project management courses , such as the PMP course, will not only give you a certification that boosts your salary and signifies to employers that you have the skills to succeed, but they give you increased flexibility in the way you manage a project and allow you to network and gain confidence. Galen Low, General Manager at The Digital Project Manager, commented: “It’s really interesting to see the difference between average annual salary for project management positions in 2023 compared to a few years ago. “While the US economy is currently facing challenges with surging inflation and slow economic activity, it’s no secret that the project management industry is booming and will continue to increase rapidly due to high demand. “But while there’s more jobs than ever, it’s now even more critical for those seeking project management roles to upskill by getting the necessary qualifications – especially if they want a desirable salary.” You can find out more information on the study here .'}]"

Leadership Though you don’t spearhead projects yourself in this role, your entire job is guiding others through a project. That requires management and leadership skills to feel comfortable doing things such as facilitating meetings, holding participants accountable and enforcing constraints. A project manager faces a particularly tough task in this role, because they have to be able to provide leadership for the project without being in a leadership or decision-making position. 6. Communication Hand in hand with leadership is strong communication. You’re the point of contact for parties in a project who may have no other contact with each other, and you have to facilitate cohesive teamwork within that environment. Many project management platforms offer real-time chat tools that can be used to message team members and groups instantly. You should feel confident interpreting the needs of one group or department and explaining them to another. You’ll likely also mediate conflicts among stakeholders and handle negotiations about time, cost and scope. You have to be able to understand everyone’s role and perspective while diplomatically communicating them across the project. Project managers should be masters of written, verbal and visual communication. You’ll face instances of all three, and mastering them all lets you communicate effectively with a diverse group of project stakeholders. Communicating effectively is now easier than ever, thanks to many of the best project management software platforms offering real-time chat tools. Pro Tip “With the rise of remote work and distributed teams, project managers must be comfortable using tools such as Slack, Zoom and Google Meet to communicate with team members, stakeholders and clients.” —Brett Day, project management expert 7. Time Management In addition to learning hard skills for planning, forecasting and scheduling projects, you should possess or develop a personal strength for time management. Do you feel comfortable juggling multiple deadlines, constraints and stakeholder needs—or do you become overwhelmed when you’re faced with too many priorities at once? Learning to calmly and consistently manage a complex timeline and help others stay on task is a vital skill for project management. So is the innate ability to foresee complications that could derail your timeline and suggest solutions to stay on track. This is a soft skill you can learn, but project management is probably best suited for those who have a natural tendency toward organization and order. 8. Patience Being at the center of multiple teams attempting to work together toward a common goal can be rewarding—and it can be frustrating. You’re in charge of managing disparate expectations and objectives, all while mediating conflict,communicating needs and helping everyone around you work within the constraints you’re given for a project. All of these require serious patience. You can’t help a project succeed if you give in to frustration when challenges arise or milestones aren’t met. You can’t facilitate communication and teamwork if you absorb the frustrations or resentments boiling among teams. Your ability to remain a calm, neutral party is vital to your success as a project manager, as well as the success of a project and the success and satisfaction of the people working on it. Your patience through challenges can inspire persistence and diffuse conflicts, while your impatience or frustration could equally demoralize and exacerbate problems. 9. Adaptability Tools and strategies for project management are constantly evolving toward better efficiency, teamwork and communication. You should enjoy and excel at learning new programs and methods quickly and encouraging others to get on board. Learning to use tools such as Trello will help make your job easier. A measure of tech-savviness is important because much of your role is understanding and properly using project management software such as Trello , as well as other tools for things such as analytics, document creation and sharing and communication. Soft skills such as adaptability and flexibility are equally important here, too. You have to exhibit a willingness to learn and adopt new technology and techniques before you can learn the hard skills to use them. A nimble mindset sets you up for success with anything new that’ll be thrown at you, regardless of your starting level of tech know-how. Your mindset is also important for the success of the people you work with. You need their buy-in to keep communication clear and tasks on track, and you can only get that if you’re fully on board with new tools and methods yourself. 10. Critical Thinking Key for any management role, critical thinking will come into play daily in project management. You have to be able to make quick decisions within a set of constraints, foreseeing the potential implications for the future of a project. Critical thinking in project management supports your ability to analyze the data and information you’re given to make decisions in the planning stage, and then carry that knowledge throughout the project as conditions change. It helps you make calls as needed to negotiate constraints and hold stakeholders accountable.'}, {'title': '15 Essential Skills Every Project Manager Needs in 2025 - Edstellar', 'url': 'https://www.edstellar.com/blog/project-manager-skills', 'content': \"Mastering the art of project management is like conducting a symphony of tasks, deadlines, and stakeholders.

                "content": "You are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity."

Leadership Though you don’t spearhead projects yourself in this role, your entire job is guiding others through a project. That requires management and leadership skills to feel comfortable doing things such as facilitating meetings, holding participants accountable and enforcing constraints. A project manager faces a particularly tough task in this role, because they have to be able to provide leadership for the project without being in a leadership or decision-making position. 6. Communication Hand in hand with leadership is strong communication. You’re the point of contact for parties in a project who may have no other contact with each other, and you have to facilitate cohesive teamwork within that environment. Many project management platforms offer real-time chat tools that can be used to message team members and groups instantly. You should feel confident interpreting the needs of one group or department and explaining them to another. You’ll likely also mediate conflicts among stakeholders and handle negotiations about time, cost and scope. You have to be able to understand everyone’s role and perspective while diplomatically communicating them across the project. Project managers should be masters of written, verbal and visual communication. You’ll face instances of all three, and mastering them all lets you communicate effectively with a diverse group of project stakeholders. Communicating effectively is now easier than ever, thanks to many of the best project management software platforms offering real-time chat tools. Pro Tip “With the rise of remote work and distributed teams, project managers must be comfortable using tools such as Slack, Zoom and Google Meet to communicate with team members, stakeholders and clients.” —Brett Day, project management expert 7. Time Management In addition to learning hard skills for planning, forecasting and scheduling projects, you should possess or develop a personal strength for time management. Do you feel comfortable juggling multiple deadlines, constraints and stakeholder needs—or do you become overwhelmed when you’re faced with too many priorities at once? Learning to calmly and consistently manage a complex timeline and help others stay on task is a vital skill for project management. So is the innate ability to foresee complications that could derail your timeline and suggest solutions to stay on track. This is a soft skill you can learn, but project management is probably best suited for those who have a natural tendency toward organization and order. 8. Patience Being at the center of multiple teams attempting to work together toward a common goal can be rewarding—and it can be frustrating. You’re in charge of managing disparate expectations and objectives, all while mediating conflict,communicating needs and helping everyone around you work within the constraints you’re given for a project. All of these require serious patience. You can’t help a project succeed if you give in to frustration when challenges arise or milestones aren’t met. You can’t facilitate communication and teamwork if you absorb the frustrations or resentments boiling among teams. Your ability to remain a calm, neutral party is vital to your success as a project manager, as well as the success of a project and the success and satisfaction of the people working on it. Your patience through challenges can inspire persistence and diffuse conflicts, while your impatience or frustration could equally demoralize and exacerbate problems. 9. Adaptability Tools and strategies for project management are constantly evolving toward better efficiency, teamwork and communication. You should enjoy and excel at learning new programs and methods quickly and encouraging others to get on board. Learning to use tools such as Trello will help make your job easier. A measure of tech-savviness is important because much of your role is understanding and properly using project management software such as Trello , as well as other tools for things such as analytics, document creation and sharing and communication. Soft skills such as adaptability and flexibility are equally important here, too. You have to exhibit a willingness to learn and adopt new technology and techniques before you can learn the hard skills to use them. A nimble mindset sets you up for success with anything new that’ll be thrown at you, regardless of your starting level of tech know-how. Your mindset is also important for the success of the people you work with. You need their buy-in to keep communication clear and tasks on track, and you can only get that if you’re fully on board with new tools and methods yourself. 10. Critical Thinking Key for any management role, critical thinking will come into play daily in project management. You have to be able to make quick decisions within a set of constraints, foreseeing the potential implications for the future of a project. Critical thinking in project management supports your ability to analyze the data and information you’re given to make decisions in the planning stage, and then carry that knowledge throughout the project as conditions change. It helps you make calls as needed to negotiate constraints and hold stakeholders accountable.'}, {'title': '27 Must-Have Project Management Skills You Need in 2025', 'url': 'https://www.scienceofpeople.com/project-management-skills/', 'content': 'Whether you’re a seasoned pro or someone who’s never heard of a Gantt chart, this guide is for you. Because here’s the thing: project management is everywhere and essential! If you’ve ever planned a party, organized a group trip, or tackled a DIY project, you’ve already dipped your toes into project management. We’ve put together this guide to the 27 must-have project management skills you need to thrive in this brave new world. Let’s dive in and explore what it takes to be a project management maestro in 2024. What Are Project Management Skills? (And Why They’re Your Secret Weapon) Project management is the systematic approach to planning, executing, and completing these complex projects, while project management skills are the competencies that enable you to navigate this process effectively. These skills encompass a range of abilities, from technical expertise to interpersonal finesse and everything in between. We’ll get into those in more detail, but—in essence—project management skills are your professional Swiss Army knife for getting things done . Here is what you need to be an excellent project manager: Soft Skills: These are the interpersonal skills that help you navigate the human side of project management. From communication and leadership to emotional intelligence and conflict resolution, soft skills help keep your team motivated, aligned, and working smoothly together. Skills: These are the skills that form the backbone of project management. Think risk management, budgeting, scheduling, and quality control. These skills help you plan, execute, and deliver projects efficiently and effectively. Technical Skills: In today’s tech-driven world, a project manager needs to be comfortable with a variety of digital tools and concepts. From creating Gantt charts and managing Kanban boards to leveraging AI and cloud computing, these skills help you harness technology to supercharge your project management capabilities. If these categories seem broad to you, that’s because they are. But that’s also why they’re so powerful—they’re relevant everywhere, no matter your industry or role. Now let’s get more specific! 10 Soft Skills to Know: The People-Pleasing Powerhouses Communication In a collaborative work environment, it’s vital to ensure everyone’s on the same page—especially when that page might be constantly being overturned or overwritten. When communication flows smoothly , tasks are completed efficiently, misunderstandings are minimized, and team morale stays high. In addition to speaking clearly and getting your message across, good communication requires openness, honesty and, perhaps most importantly, trust between coworkers. Here are the top communication skills every good project manager should have: Assertiveness: Expressing your thoughts and needs confidently and respectfully. If you need help on assertiveness watch our founder’s free training on how to be both nice and assertive . Facilitation : Guiding discussions and meetings to ensure productive outcomes and participation from all involved. Active Listening : Paying full attention to the speaker and understanding their message before responding. Empathy : Understanding and being sensitive to the feelings and perspectives of others. Nonverbal Communication : Using body language, facial expressions, and gestures to reinforce verbal messages. Feedback: Providing constructive feedback that is specific, actionable, and aimed at improvement. Conflict Resolution: Addressing and resolving disagreements in a way that is fair and beneficial to all parties involved. Negotiation : Finding mutually acceptable solutions during discussions with stakeholders or team members. Public Speaking: Effectively presenting information to groups, whether in meetings or formal presentations. Persuasion: Convincing others to understand and support your ideas or plans. Emotional Intelligence : Recognizing and managing your own emotions, as well as understanding others’ emotions. Rapport Building: Establishing a connection and trust with team members and stakeholders. Want help with these?

Register below to get your FREE chapter of Captivate. Emotional Intelligence IQ might get you hired, but emotional intelligence (EQ) gets the project done. In fact, research has found that emotional intelligence is one of the strongest predictors of job performance, explaining around 58% of success in all types of jobs. EQ is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. In project management, this translates to skills like: Self-awareness : Recognizing your own emotional state and how it affects your work Self-regulation: Managing your reactions, especially in high-stress situations Empathy: Understanding and responding to the emotions of your team members Social skills: Building relationships and navigating social complexities So, the next time you feel your blood pressure rising during a tense project meeting, take a deep breath. Reflect: ask yourself, “What am I feeling right now? Why? How might others be feeling?” Then choose your response based on this reflection, rather than reacting impulsively. Leadership Management guru Peter Drucker once said , “management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.” Effective leadership in project management is about making smart calls when the path isn’t clear, inspiring your team when motivation wanes, and keeping the big picture in focus while juggling the day-to-day chaos. And leadership isn’t just for the folks with fancy titles. It’s a skill that everyone on the team can—and should—flex. Whether you’re the official project manager or the newest team member, you’ve got the power to lead by example, speak up with ideas, and help steer the ship. Vision: Successful leaders grasp the big picture. A project manager might articulate how the current project aligns with the company’s five-year strategy, while a team member could highlight how their specific task contributes to the overall project goals. Both are demonstrating leadership by helping others understand the broader context of their work. Decisiveness: Strong leaders make tough calls when needed. A project manager might need to decide on cutting features to meet a deadline, while a developer might choose to flag a potential security risk even if it means delaying their part of the project. Both scenarios require the courage to make difficult decisions for the greater good of the project. Humility: Perhaps counterintuitively, great leaders aren’t afraid to admit when they’re wrong. A project manager admitting they underestimated a task’s complexity sets a tone of honesty and continuous learning. Similarly, a team member openly asking for help on a challenging assignment encourages a culture of collaboration and growth. To practice leadership, consider starting a “leadership journal”. Each day, identify one opportunity where you can demonstrate leadership, be proposing a solution to a nagging problem, mentoring a colleague, or taking initiative on a task no one wants to do. Write them down, reflect on them and then, at the end of the week, pick something to try to make a regular habit. Pro Tip: Do you wish you got recognition for your hard work?

Adaptability Remember how fast everything changed when covid-19 hit? The project managers who thrived were the ones who could pivot faster than a startup’s business model. Adaptability refers to the capacity to deal with—even embrace—change. That could mean reacting to a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic. But it could also involve simply being flexible in your daily operations while dealing with free-flowing and unpredictable project demands. Here are some key components of adaptability in project management: Adjusting your communication style for different team members Example : You notice that your detail-oriented developer prefers written instructions, while your creative designer responds better to visual explanations. So, you send the developer a detailed email brief, but schedule a quick sketch session with the designer for the same project update. Being open to new methodologies or technologies that could improve efficiency Example : A team member suggests trying a new project management tool that uses AI to predict potential bottlenecks. Despite your initial hesitation, you agree to a trial run. The tool ends up saving your team hours of manual work each week. Quickly reprioritizing tasks when unexpected issues arise Example : Midway through your sprint, a critical security flaw is discovered in a key feature. You immediately pause less urgent tasks, reassign your best debuggers to address the issue, and adjust the sprint goals to accommodate this unexpected priority. To boost your adaptability, try this: At the end of each week, reflect on a challenge you faced. How did you adapt? What could you have done differently? By regularly practicing this reflection, you’ll build your “adaptability muscle” and be better prepared for whatever curveballs your projects throw at you. Conflict Resolution Conflicts in projects are like potholes on a road trip—unavoidable but manageable. Your job? Be a calm, mediating, almost Jedi-like presence that turns (inevitable) conflicts into learning experiences that actually strengthen team relationships and improve project outcomes. Here are some actionable tips to help you squash workplace conflicts with a running example: Listen to all sides without interrupting Scenario: Design team wants a sleek UI; dev team says it’s not feasible. Example: You hold a meeting, giving each team uninterrupted time to explain their stance. Identify the root cause, not just the symptoms Scenario : Seems like a design disagreement, but there’s more to it. Example: Questioning reveals a lack of early collaboration between teams. Brainstorm solutions together, encouraging creativity Scenario: Teams need to find a way to work together better. Example: In a brainstorming session, someone suggests a “design-dev buddy system.” Implement the agreed-upon solution and follow up Scenario: Teams agree on the buddy system idea. Example: You pair designers with developers and schedule a check-in meeting for next month. For more tips, check out our in-depth guide on conflict resolution in the workplace. Time Management “The bad news is time flies,” serial entrepreneur Michael Altshuler once said. “The good news is you’re the pilot”. As possibly one of the most important soft skills to master, productivity gurus have developed countless different time management systems and methodologies for you to try. Most of them are tied together by a few common threads: Prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency Example: Try the Eisenhower Matrix for prioritizing tasks. Simply divide your to-do list into four quadrants: Urgent and Important: Do these tasks immediately Important but Not Urgent: Schedule these tasks Urgent but Not Important: Delegate these tasks if possible Neither Urgent nor Important: Eliminate these tasks Settling realistic deadlines (and learning to say no to requests that don’t align with project goals) Scheduling Example: Comprehensively block out your day on Google Calendar, utilizing different colors for different kinds of tasks and activities Of course, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution for time management. Everybody’s brain works a little differently. Some people might like digital to-do lists while others prefer good ol’ pen and paper. Some might be okay with all of their tasks dumped into one giant bucket, while others need them meticulously categorized and color-coded. The key is to experiment and find what works for you. In the meantime, you can check out our article here: 33 Best Time Management Tips For Work and Study Negotiation In project management, you’re always negotiating. Resources, deadlines, scope—you name it, it’s up for discussion. Negotiating, especially in a business context, is often associated with “winning”. But this often leads to adversarial relationships and missed opportunities for creative solutions. Instead of viewing negotiation as a zero-sum game, try to reframe it so that you’re looking for mutually beneficial solutions. Harvard Law School’s Program on Negotiation suggests the “BATNA” approach—Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. Your BATNA is the most favorable outcome you can accept if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. Know your BATNA so that you can gain leverage while ensuring a beneficial outcome for all parties. Here’s an example of both parties putting BATNA to action in a project management context: A software development company is negotiating with a client about the timeline for a complex project. The client wants the project completed in 3 months, but the development team estimates it will take 5 months. The company’s BATNA: Taking on a different, less challenging project that would start in 4 months. The client’s BATNA: Hiring a less experienced, but immediately available, development team. Understanding these BATNAs, they reach a mutually beneficial agreement: The project will be completed in 4 months, with the most critical features prioritized for an initial release at the 3-month mark. This solution allows the client to start using key functionalities earlier, while giving the development team adequate time to ensure quality. Both parties prefer this outcome to their respective BATNAs. Creativity In the same way that project management isn’t just for people with the title of “project manager”, creativity isn’t just for artists. In fact, Albert Einstein—one of the most iconic figures in a field that is often considered diametrically opposed to creativity—said that “creativity is intelligence having fun”. In project management, having fun with your intelligence can be a catalyst for problem-solving and innovation. When faced with a challenge, channel your inner MacGyver. Can you solve it with the resources at hand? Can you approach it from a completely different angle? To boost your creativity, try the SCAMPER technique, a brainstorming methods that uses seven different approaches to generate innovative ideas and solutions: S ubstitute: Can you replace part of the process or product? Example: Replace weekly email updates with a real-time project dashboard. C ombine: Can you merge ideas or stages? Example: Merge daily stand-up meetings with task assignment sessions. A dapt: How can you adjust the process to fit other contexts? Example: Adjust the communication strategy to include remote team members by using video conferencing. M odify: Can you change the shape, look, or feel? Example: Change the format of progress reports from text-heavy documents to visual infographics. P ut to another use: Can you use this process or product elsewhere? Example: Repurpose the project chat channel as a knowledge-sharing platform. E liminate: What can you remove to simplify? Example: Remove unnecessary CC’d emails by implementing a centralized communication tool. R everse: Can you rearrange or reverse the process? Example: Instead of managers giving top-down updates, have team members present progress to leadership. Want more? Check out our ultimate creativity video below! Cultural Intelligence Cultural intelligence (CQ) is the oft-overlooked cousin of IQ and EQ. Defined as the “capacity to function and manage effectively in culturally diverse settings”, CQ is a vital skill in a globalized world and a multicultural workplace. Indeed, a large body of academic research shows that QC is strongly and consistently associated with individual and business success. So, how do you develop your CQ? Learn about different cultural norms and practices Choose a country or culture you’re likely to interact with and spend time researching its business etiquette, communication styles, and social norms. Apply this knowledge in your next interaction with someone from that culture. Be aware of your own cultural biases Think about how your cultural norms and practices might differ from the ones you studied in step 1. Jot down instances where you made assumptions based on your cultural norms, and reflect on how these might differ in other cultures. Practice empathy and open-mindedness Next time you encounter a cultural difference that challenges your way of thinking, pause before reacting. Ask yourself, “What might be the reasoning behind this approach?” Then, engage in a respectful dialogue to understand the other person’s perspective. Critical Thinking Critical thinking is your mental toolkit for navigating complex problems. Think of it as your inner Sherlock Holmes—observing, analyzing, and asking the right questions to solve mysteries in your projects: How did I reach this conclusion? Are there alternative explanations? Am I overlooking any crucial information? In project management, critical thinking involves: Analyzing information objectively Identifying potential biases and assumptions Evaluating arguments and evidence Making logical connections between ideas Considering alternative perspectives and solutions To sharpen your critical thinking skills, try the IDEAL approach: I – Identify the problem Example: Project timelines are not being met. D – Define the context Example: Examine the project environment, team capacity, and current processes. E – Enumerate choices Example: List possible solutions like adjusting timelines, increasing resources, or improving processes. A – Analyze options Example: Evaluate each option based on feasibility, cost, and potential impact. L – List reasons explicitly Example: Clearly articulate the reasoning behind your chosen solution. 10 Hard Skills to Master for Project Managers: The Nitty-Gritty Know-How Risk Management It’s a truism that things don’t always go to plan. Anytime you make a decision, you’re also taking a risk that that decision won’t pan out like you hope. Risk management is about expecting the unexpected—and preparing for it. You can’t predict the future, but you can have contingency plans in case things go awry. Here’s how to get started with risk management: Identify potential risks Begin by brainstorming all possible risks that could affect your project. This includes internal risks (like team turnover or resource availability) and external risks (such as market changes or regulatory shifts). Document these risks in a risk register for ongoing reference. Assess their likelihood and potential impact Create a risk matrix to categorize risks into four quadrants: low likelihood/low impact, low likelihood/high impact, high likelihood/low impact, and high likelihood/high impact. This visual tool helps prioritize which risks need immediate attention. Develop mitigation strategies For each high-priority risk, develop strategies to minimize its impact or likelihood. This could involve creating contingency plans, allocating additional resources, or implementing preventive measures. Monitor and review regularly Schedule regular risk review meetings to assess the status of identified risks and discuss any new risks that may have emerged. Update the risk register accordingly and adjust mitigation strategies as needed. Budgeting and Cost Control People say that money makes the world go round, and it certainly makes projects go round too. Budgeting and cost control are the unsung heroes of project management. Here’s a practical approach to budgeting and cost control: Start with a detailed cost estimate: Break down all project components and estimate their costs. Don’t forget to include both direct costs (like materials) and indirect costs (like overhead). Build in contingencies: Consider a buffer of 5-10% for known risks and another 5-10% for unknown risks. This gives you wiggle room when the unexpected happens (and it will). Track expenses religiously: Use project management software to monitor expenses in real-time. This allows you to spot potential overruns before they become major issues. Conduct regular budget reviews: Schedule monthly or bi-weekly budget reviews to ensure you’re on track. These reviews are also great opportunities to reassess priorities and make adjustments if needed. Be transparent about finances: Keep your higher-ups informed about the project’s financial health. This builds trust and can make it easier to secure additional resources if needed. Scheduling If time is money, then scheduling is your project’s piggy bank. The Gantt chart, invented by Henry Gantt in the early 1900s, remains a popular scheduling tool (we’ll go into more depth on this later!). A good schedule is realistic, flexible, and communicated clearly to everyone involved in the project. Here are some general tips: Break down the project: Start by creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This hierarchical decomposition of the project scope helps you identify all the tasks that need to be scheduled. Identify dependencies: Determine which tasks depend on others. This helps you sequence activities logically and avoid bottlenecks. Estimate durations: Be realistic about how long tasks will take. It’s often helpful to use the PERT formula: (Optimistic + 4x Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6. In this formula, “Optimistic” represents the fastest possible amount of time, “Most Likely” is a realistic estimate and “Pessimistic” is the slowest amount of time. Allocate resources: Assign team members and other resources to tasks. Be mindful of resource constraints and avoid over-allocation. Build in buffers: Like with budgeting, include some wiggle room in your schedule. This helps absorb unexpected delays. Use scheduling software: Tools like Microsoft Project, Notion, or Trello can help you create and manage complex schedules. Monitor and adjust: Regularly review your schedule and make adjustments as needed. A schedule is a living document, not set in stone Quality Management Quality management is the process of ensuring that project deliverables meet or exceed expectations through planning, assurance, and control. As Aristotle said, “Quality is not an act, it’s a habit,” and in project management, it’s a habit that can make or break your project. The cost of poor quality can be significant. According to research , many organizations have quality-related costs as high as 15-20% of sales revenue, with some going as high as 40% of total operations. If the idea of managing “quality” seems kinda abstract to you, don’t worry; here are some practical tips to ensure you’re consistently meeting (and exceeding) expectations: Planning: Defining quality standards Example: In software development, clearly specify that the app loads within 3 seconds and is compatible with the last three versions of major browsers. Assurance: Ensuring processes are followed Example: Implement code reviews where senior developers check juniors’ work before integration. Control: Monitoring and correcting deviations Example: In manufacturing, test every 100th item to ensure it meets specifications. Scope Management Scope management is the process of defining, documenting, and controlling the specific work and deliverables required to complete a project successfully. Without it, projects have a nasty tendency to balloon beyond its initial boundaries. When starting a project, make sure you definitively outline what is (and isn’t) included in your project; along the way, learn to say “no” to unnecessary additions and “yes” to changes that truly add value. Here’s a 5-step process to effectively manage scope: Plan Scope Management Outline a plan for how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled, setting the ground rules for how scope-related decisions will be made throughout the project. Collect Requirements Gather and document needs and expectations. This might involve interviews, surveys, focus groups, or workshops. The goal is to understand what the project needs to deliver to satisfy the bosses. Define Scope Using the collected requirements, create a detailed description of the project and its deliverables. This typically results in a scope statement that clearly outlines what is and isn’t included in the project. Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) The WBS breaks down the project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. It’s a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work, helping to ensure nothing is overlooked. Validate Scope Formally accept the completed project deliverables, confirming that what’s been produced aligns with what was agreed upon in the scope statement. Procurement Management Procurement management encompasses the strategic processes of acquiring goods, services, and resources essential for successful project completion. It’s all about making sure you’ve got everything you need, from the right people, at the right time, and for the best possible value. Key components include: Identifying what needs to be procured Selecting vendors Managing contracts Closing procurements A study by McKinsey found that effective procurement management can lead to cost savings of 3-8% for most organizations. That’s not pocket change! Pro Tip: Build strong relationships with your vendors or clients. They can be valuable partners in your project’s success, and potentially offer you discounted prices later down the line! Check out this article for tips on building rapport via body language: Body Language for Rapport Change Management Change management is the process of guiding your project and team through transitions, minimizing disruptions while maximizing opportunities. As Greek philosopher Heraclitus wisely noted, “The only constant in life is change,” and this rings especially true in project management. In essence, change management is about: Anticipating potential changes Evaluating their impact Planning for implementation Supporting your team through the transition Projects rarely go exactly as planned. New client demands, shifting deadlines, or unexpected challenges can throw a wrench in the works. Effective change management helps you navigate these obstacles without losing sight of your project goals. Project roadmapping Project roadmapping is the art of visualizing your project’s journey from start to finish. It’s about creating a high-level overview that shows the major phases, milestones, and deliverables of your project over time. This bird’s-eye view is particularly valuable for complex initiatives, helping to align everyone before the project kicks off. A well-designed project roadmap: Provides a visual timeline of the project Highlights key milestones and dependencies Aligns team members on project goals and progress Helps stakeholders understand the project’s trajectory Traditionally, project roadmaps have been created using Gantt chart-like software, displaying the project schedule as a horizontal bar chart. Today, there are various tools available for creating effective roadmaps. For instance, you might use Timeline in Asana , or other project management software like Microsoft Project , Jira , or Trello , which offer features to create visual roadmaps. Writing a project brief A project brief is where all the hard project management skills we’ve discussed so far (e.g., scope management, budgeting, etc.) come together to create a compact blueprint of your project. This blueprint is your project’s genome—a go-to reference that keeps everyone aligned on the project’s purpose, scope, and goals. A well-crafted project brief typically includes: Project overview and objectives Scope and deliverables Timeline and key milestones Budget constraints Stakeholders and their roles Potential risks and mitigation strategies The strength of a project brief lies in its clarity and brevity. It should be detailed enough to provide direction, but concise enough to be quickly digestible. Think of it as the executive summary for your project, expanded just enough to guide your team through execution. Remember, a good project brief isn’t set in stone. As your project evolves, revisit and update the brief to ensure it remains a relevant and useful tool throughout the project lifecycle. Project Management Certifications Did you know you can go to project manager training? There are a few options here, but our founder Vanessa Van Edwards has spoken at the Project Management Institute annual convention. They also have a certification program that can give you the skills you need as a project manager. They are not a sponsor of this article, we are just a fan of their work for project managers. 8 Technical Skills Great Project Managers Need: The Digital Dynamos Gantt Charts Gantt charts are the classic visual tool for project scheduling, named after their creator, Henry Gantt. These horizontal bar charts offer a clear, intuitive way to display project tasks over time. Key features of Gantt charts include: Visual representation of tasks and their durations Clear display of task dependencies Easy identification of the critical path Ability to show project milestones Gantt charts shine when you need to: Plan complex projects with multiple interdependent tasks Communicate project timelines to colleagues Track progress against the original schedule While traditionally created on paper or spreadsheets, modern project management software often includes Gantt chart functionality, making them easier to create and update. Kanban Boards Kanban, meaning “visual sign” in Japanese, is a visual method for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban boards are the physical or digital manifestation of this method. A typical Kanban board consists of columns representing different stages of your workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), with tasks represented as cards that move through these stages. Key benefits of Kanban boards include: Visual workflow management Limiting work-in-progress to prevent bottlenecks Facilitating continuous improvement Promoting team collaboration and transparency Kanban boards are particularly useful for: Managing ongoing processes or projects with a continuous flow of tasks Teams practicing Agile or Lean methodologies Visualizing workload and identifying bottlenecks Project Management Software From creating Gantt charts to drafting up a brief, there are a plethora of project management software tools to help you plan, execute, and monitor your projects with ease. And though they’re definitely designed with ease-of-use in mind, mastering and getting the most out of these tools can take time and practice. A few popular options include: Jira for software development projects Trello for simple, visual task management Microsoft Project for complex, large-scale projects Notion for pretty much everything (no, seriously; it’s probably the most versatile and customizable tool on the market!) Data Fluency “Data is the new oil”, or so the saying goes. It’s possibly the single-most valuable resource in the digital world, and it’s no different in business or project management. Whether you need to crunch financials, estimate client satisfaction, or monitor KPIs, data will permeate every aspect of any project you oversee. And while you don’t need to be a data scientist yourself, a general level of comfort when it comes to understanding and communicating insights from data is absolutely crucial for any project manager. As a project manager, your data fluency might come into play when: Interpreting project performance metrics Understanding and presenting budget reports Analyzing team productivity data Reading and acting on satisfaction surveys Recognizing trends in project timelines or resource allocation As statistician W. Edwards Deming said, “In God we trust. All others must bring data.” With remote work becoming the norm, mastering collaboration tools is more important than ever. From video conferencing to virtual whiteboards, these tools help bridge the gap when face-to-face meetings aren’t possible. Popular collaboration tools include: Slack for team communication Zoom for video conferencing Miro for virtual brainstorming Agile Methodologies Agile methodologies are project management approaches that break work down into small, manageable chunks rather than following a grand master plan. These methods prioritize flexibility, adaptation, collaboration, and rapid delivery of value. While originally developed for software projects, Agile principles can be applied to many types of projects across various industries and departments. In fact, roughly 80% of respondents in a study conducted by Harvard Business Review said they were using agile in some way. Agile methodologies are built into some project management frameworks such as Kanban (which we already covered). Other common components include: Daily standups: Brief, daily team meetings where each member shares progress, plans, and obstacles. Retrospectives: Regular sessions where the team reflects on their work process and identifies improvements. Sprints and iteration planning: Short, fixed periods (usually 1-4 weeks) for completing a set of tasks, with planning sessions at the start of each sprint. According to research, embracing these methodologies lead to: Better ability to manage changing priorities Faster delivery speed Better employee engagement and morale Cloud Computing The cloud has revolutionized how we store, access, and share project data. Again, you don’t need to be a data engineer or cloud computing whizz, but knowing your way around the cloud can be invaluable for a project manager. Cloud platforms like AWS , Google Cloud , and Microsoft Azure offer scalable, flexible solutions for project hosting and collaboration. They allow teams to work from anywhere, anytime, on any device. If your company is large, there’s a good chance your data will be on one of these platforms. But with great power comes great responsibility. Ensure you understand the security implications of cloud computing and implement appropriate safeguards. AI is transforming the landscape of business and project management. No longer an abstract, futuristic technology, AI tools designed to enhance efficiency at work are cropping up like mushrooms after a spring rain.

Learn what skills are necessary to become a successful project manager and how to build them. At Asana, we believe that if you manage projects, you’re a project manager… even if that’s not your job title. In order for teams to effectively collaborate and get their best work done, they need a project manager like you to lead the way. But even if you’re already managing a project—or even multiple projects —how do you get better at being a project manager? If you’re interested in honing and developing your project management skills, you’re in the right place. In this guide, we’ll cover 25 key skills you need to succeed as a project manager or project administrator , and how you can develop those skills over time. See Asana in action Drive clarity and impact at scale by connecting work and workflows to company-wide goals. What are project management skills (and why do they matter?) Project management skills are the attributes you develop to become a more experienced project manager. Building a project management skill set includes learning technical and hard skills, such as portfolio management and project scoping, and soft skills (for example, adaptability).In honing these skills, you’re preparing yourself to more effectively perform in your role. Project management is the practice of organizing and executing work efficiently—and helping your team do the same. For a while, project managers had to be trained and certified in complicated project management technology. Traditional project management tools were hard to set up and required constant maintenance, which is where the position “project manager” comes from. Modern project management evolved from traditional project management in two distinct ways. As companies and teams democratized their project management processes, they needed more team members and team leads who were able to manage a process from conception to completion. In order to support those team leads, project management software has also evolved, from complex mechanisms to flexible and easy-to-use tools. Today, any team member may be called upon to run a project and become the de-facto project manager—which is why modern project management tools are built to be flexible enough for anyone to use on any project, so you’re able to jump in and hit the ground running. These tools, like Asana , make it easy to track, manage, and organize work—without the learning curve associated with traditional tools. With today's project management tools , you can easily implement project management best practices and bring a new level of clarity and visibility to your project team. How to use your project management skills Project management tools do the heavy lifting when it comes to reducing silos, increasing visibility, and facilitating cross-functional collaboration. As the project manager, you can use these tools to give your team the insight they need to get their best work done. While you don’t need to learn complicated skills or tools in order to become a successful project manager , there are hard, soft, and technical skills you can develop in order to improve your management and collaboration skills. Some of these skills might not apply to you—while others might be things you’re already seasoned in. Like everything in the five phases of project management , approach this list with flexibility and work on the skills that are most relevant to you. 10 soft skills for project managers Soft skills are what we call “non-technical skills,” or skills that can help you improve your quality of work—without a specific tool or technical requirement. These are also called “people skills” or “interpersonal skills” because they often help you work with and relate to others in your workspace. These 10 skills are the most important soft skills for project management: 1. Collaboration Collaboration is the cornerstone of all project management skills. In project management, collaboration helps you get work done quickly and more efficiently. When you can coordinate across teams, you gain valuable insights into your project that you might not find within your team. If more minds are involved in the work, projects are inherently more creative and well developed. To improve your collaboration skills, practice having conversations. Use techniques like active listening , where you stay engaged and focused when others are speaking to you. It sounds simple, but learning how to have open communication, reduce boundaries, and co-create are critical for a collaborative team. Read: 10 easy steps to boost team collaboration 2. Teamwork Everyone on your team has something to bring to the table, and your team is more effective working together than they would be alone. Teamwork ensures that everyone feels welcome, valued, and they are supported to contribute. If you’re working to boost your teamwork skills, dig deeper into team brainstorms , 1:1 conversations, and ask for feedback from your team—how can you be a better team member? Notice if there’s someone who hasn’t spoken up in a while, and be supportive when another team member has a new idea. 3. Communication Miscommunications are common when you’re working with a group of people. Learning how to communicate well and avoid these will make projects run more smoothly and be more enjoyable. To develop your communication skills, practice being open and honest with your coworkers. This requires a lot of trust between you and your team members. To build this trust, encourage your team members to bring any thoughts into a discussion—even if you disagree with them. 4. Time management Time management and organization skills go hand in hand. As you become better at organizing your tasks, you’ll also have a clearer sense of everything that’s on your plate and how long your upcoming tasks are going to take. Still, it can be hard to buckle down and prioritize your work. To improve your time management skills and reduce procrastination, try prioritizing tasks. When you’re clear on which tasks are higher priority, you can tackle them first, to make sure nothing gets left behind or falls through the cracks. 5. Leadership Even if you don’t think of yourself as a leader or have a role in team management, when you’re managing a project, your project team is looking to you for leadership, guidance, and support. To develop your leadership skills, practice approaching situations with empathy and understanding. Good leaders bring everyone together and make them feel supported to foster teamwork and collaboration. 6. Organization For a lot of project managers, organization is the most intimidating soft skill. You might think organization is either something you “have” or “don’t have.” But, like every other project management skill in this article, you can develop your organizational skills and become a Marie Kondo in your own right. The best way to become a better organizer is to create (and maintain) a central source of truth for your work and your team’s work. We’re often disorganized because work is disconnected—in fact, the average employee switches between 10 tools per day . Instead of splitting your time between 10 tools, try using a digital organization tool to act as that one central source of truth for your team. Read: How to get organized: 17 tips that actually work 7. Problem solving Problem solving skills are collaborative, iterative skills that help you approach a problem and, ultimately, solve it. Developing problem solving skills isn’t about always having the “right” answer to every problem—rather, people with great problem solving skills practice approaching problems from new perspectives and methodically working towards a solution. To become a better problem solver, use data-driven decision-making frameworks or routine analyses. For example, if you need to solve for how to boost sales by 10% over your competition, you can run a competitive analysis to determine where you currently stand in the market. Then, use that information to solve the problem of lower sales. In this case, you could develop a new marketing strategy coordinated with the sales team. Read: Turn your team into skilled problem solvers with these problem-solving strategies 8. Critical thinking Critical thinking, like problem solving, doesn’t have a “solution.” You can’t “win” at critical thinking, but you can practice approaching problems logically instead of making decisions based on your emotions. Good critical thinkers practice analyzing information in front of them and forming their own conclusions based on the facts—the way Sherlock Holmes solves a mystery. To practice critical thinking, always take a step back and ask yourself: how did I come to this conclusion? Could there be another answer? Am I being swayed by something other than factual information? Emotional decisions aren’t necessarily bad—in fact, some of the best decisions are those we’re passionate about. But critical thinking is a helpful way to make sure you’re approaching a situation from the right perspective. 9. Adaptability At some point, whether it’s this project or the next one, aspects of your project plan will change. Maybe your deadline or priorities shifts, and you need to adapt your workflow accordingly. Great project managers are able to pivot and adapt to new situations to continue steering their project team in the right direction. Becoming more adaptable is all about understanding when and how to shift gears. To do this, you need to understand yourself. Developing other soft skills, such as self-awareness and mindfulness, can help you be more in touch with and manage your emotions, which are often in flux during times of change. Read: 6 Tips to Increase Your Adaptability In the Workplace 10. Conflict resolution Inevitably, conflict will arise during the projects you manage. It could be that a stakeholder wants to change the project scope. Or maybe you missed your budget or deadline. Conflict resolution is about addressing both sides of the conflict so everyone feels heard and supported. If there are harmed parties, take the time to listen to them and try to find a solution that works for everyone. Even when that can’t happen, approaching the conversation with patience and empathy can help defuse a potentially frustrating situation and lead to a better result. 7 hard skills for project managers Unlike soft skills, hard skills are quantifiable abilities. While the soft skills mentioned above are applicable for many work skills, these seven hard skills are relevant specifically to project management. Developing these will help you become a more well rounded and efficient project manager. Manage projects with one tool 1. Project planning At its core, a project plan (sometimes called a project charter) is a blueprint of the key elements your project needs to succeed. Typically a project plan will include seven things: Goals and project objectives Success metrics Stakeholders and roles Scope and budget Milestones , deliverables , and project dependencies Timeline and schedule Communication plan Some of these things, like your goals or your milestones, might already be defined in your project roadmap or brief. But your project plan is where all of these project elements come together to create a cohesive picture of your upcoming work. A lot of planning goes into the beginning of the year for what our vision is and where we will be by the end of that particular year. Once that is done, we summarize it in a project so it's visible to everyone... Having that visual representation in Asana makes it easier to move things around.” —Sheryl Chopra, Project Manager, IPG Mediabrands 2. Project scoping Project scope is the size, goals, and limitations (i.e., deadlines and resources) for your project. Your project scope will define what you can achieve within a certain timeframe and budget. Setting and defining your project scope is important in order to prevent scope creep , which is when your project deliverables outgrow your original project scope. In order to improve your project scoping skills, practice setting project scope early and often. Once you’ve set your project scope, share it with stakeholders and surface it frequently, so everyone is on the same page about the project’s aims and limitations. Use it as a point of reference, so you know when to say no to new asks. We have been able to reduce the number of products that we’ve oversold and the number of times we have to contact the customer to push a ship date out.” —Andrea Georgi, E-Commerce Director, The Citizenry 3. Writing a project brief Your project brief outlines your general project objectives and how you plan to get there. This can serve as a helpful North Star to guide planning sessions. The most important thing to remember about your project brief is that it’s a living document. As you develop your project plan and get input from stakeholders, you can adapt and update your project brief. In general, your project brief should contain a link to your project roadmap if you created one, a list of your project stakeholders and their responsibilities (sometimes called a RACI chart), other relevant documentation or files, and any other high-level information your team might need. Having executive oversight and insight into projects is key so we can quickly get up to speed on what is happening at any point.” —Jeana Abboud, COO, Social Factor 4. Hosting a project kickoff meeting A kickoff meeting is an opportunity to align with your project stakeholders. This is your chance to clarify your project goals and scope, and share any documents you’ve already put together like your project roadmap, project brief, or supplemental documentation like a bill of materials for a marketing campaign or a creative brief for a design team. To host a successful kickoff meeting, plan to share the documentation you have put together with project stakeholders. Then, host a brainstorming or Q&A session to align on any additional variables, like budget, resources , or final deliverables. 5. Project roadmapping A project roadmap is a high-level overview of your project’s key deliverables and timeline. Project roadmaps are helpful for complex initiatives with a lot of stakeholders because they help the entire project team get on the same page before the project even starts. Traditionally, project roadmaps are created in Gantt chart-like software , in order to display a general schedule of your project as a horizontal bar chart. To create a project roadmap, use a tool like Timeline in Asana to create a rough timeline of your project, adding key milestones or important dependencies. 6. Mapping your project timeline Your project timeline is the order and duration of events during your project lifecycle. Knowing your project timeline helps your team track project success and deliver the right assets on time. In order to build a great project timeline, make sure you clarify the start and end dates of your project, as well as any key milestones. As you continue building out individual tasks and deliverables, set dependencies between tasks, and clarify the start and end date of each piece of work. 7. Task management Once your project is officially underway, task management refers to how well you manage your and your team’s time. The best project managers have visibility into what their team is working on in real-time, so they can help their team effectively prioritize and execute work. But you don’t have to magically know everything that’s happening in your project—instead, use task management software. Task management software is more than a to-do list—it’s a way to get a holistic view of all of the work happening in your project. With effective task management, you can empower your team to work more productively, efficiently, and effectively. With Asana, we can see project progress and blockers, plus feedback and action items, all in one place. We're now able to complete work more efficiently and effectively, which has become even more critical while working from home. We’d be lost without it!” —Sarah Elliott, VP, Global Product Marketing, Integral Ad Science 8 technical skills all project managers need Soft skills: check. Hard skills: got it. The only thing you have left to master are technical skills! Technical skills refer to your knowledge of specific tools and softwares within project management. These tools aren’t hard to learn—as we mentioned before, modern project management is built to be flexible and easy to use. These eight skills are aspects of project management roles you should become familiar with, so you know when and how to leverage them. 1. Project management software skills Project management software has come a long way from legacy tools that were difficult to use and required a project management professional to implement. But like any tool, even easy-to-use ones, the software you choose takes time to learn and truly master. Make sure the tool you select has a written guide and helpful videos to teach you the ins and outs of how to use it. Manage projects with one tool 2. Gantt charts Gantt charts are a way to visualize your project as a horizontal bar chart, where each bar represents a piece of work and the length of each bar represents the amount of time that work will take. Traditional Gantt chart technology can be tricky to use and limited in scope, which is why, at Asana, we took the best of Gantt chart technology and created Timeline , a Gantt-chart like tool that helps you see how all of the pieces fit together. Launching an album has so many moving parts, and Asana helps us track every detail, who’s responsible for it, and when it needs to be completed.” —Brett Gurewitz, CEO, Epitaph Records 3. Kanban boards Another popular type of visual project management is the Kanban board . Each column in a Kanban board represents a stage of work, like New , In progress , or Done . Individual work is represented by cards, which move through the columns until they’re completed. Kanban boards tools are a popular visual project management tool for lean project management teams, particularly product, engineering, and software development teams. They’re an Agile methodology , designed to be adaptable and flexible to adjust to development needs in real-time. Read: A beginner's guide to Kanban boards 4. Agile management Agile management is a lean project management methodology that’s particularly popular with product, engineering, and software development teams. Agile operates on a system of continuous improvement and incremental evolution, and it encompasses several lean methodologies, like lean portfolio management , Scrum , and Kanban . In order to manage an Agile team, it's the project manager’s job to coordinate between team members and stay flexible. This can mean changing the project schedule, aligning with teams working on a different project, or just staying in touch with effective communication. 5. Workload management If you’ve managed projects before, you know how hard it is to gain clarity on who is working on what—but it doesn’t have to be. Workload management helps you measure your team’s bandwidth and make sure they aren’t over- or under-worked. It’s an interactive process that doesn’t have a beginning or end state—rather, an effective project manager will continuously monitor their team’s workload to ensure no one is burning out. There are two steps to using workload management software . First, start by figuring out your team’s capacity, competencies, and current workload. From there, allocate resources based on individual workload, or rebalance workloads as needed. 6. Cost management In project management, cost management is considering how each task impacts your budget at every stage of the project. Cost management is a key part of project leadership, and an important element of whether or not your project is a success. Staying within budget is as important as hitting your project due date, and cost management can help you get there. To manage cost effectively, good project managers define their costs and budget at the beginning of a project. Make sure project stakeholders and team members all understand the budget. Then, during the project, keep cost and budget in mind. Check in on your spending several times during the project to make sure you aren’t overshooting your budget. Once the project is completed, tally predicted cost vs. actual cost to determine how effective your cost management strategies were. This can also help you benchmark for future projects.

Project portfolio management With project portfolio management (PMM), you can get a bird’s-eye view of your team’s work across multiple projects. Unlike traditional project management, PMM involves working on multiple projects or large-scale initiatives simultaneously. Project portfolio management tools help you get a holistic view of all of your team’s work in real-time, so you can connect strategy to execution. Portfolios are also a key Asana feature for our team. It is a great tool for our executive team so they can see our big pieces of work all in a single place with the status, progress and ownership. Our CEO visits our portfolio daily and adds comments. He loves to be able to see what's going on in a snapshot.” —Michael Chidgey, PMO & Programme Manager, SiteMinder 8. Change management If you’ve ever rolled out a big organizational change, you’ve likely practiced change management, even if you didn’t know it. Change management is the process of introducing organizational change—like new processes or tools—over a set period of time to make them easier to adapt to. At Asana, we use the Asana Way of Change, a six step process developed by our Customer Success team that incorporates proven change management strategies. To learn more, read our guide to change management . The standard of our creative team, for a while, was just to react to work. But we’ll never do the best work we possibly can without a clear process.” —Joe Tornatzky, Art Director, Gear Patrol How to build your project management skills Twenty five skills might feel like a lot, but remember that you don’t need to master every skill in this list. Some, like Agile, are only relevant for specific teams. Others, like organization, become virtually effortless with a little focus and great tools . Keep in mind that developing your project management skills takes practice. Challenge yourself to focus on one or two new skills for each project—whether that’s trying out a new visual form of project management like Kanban, drafting your first ever project plan, or leaning into time-management. There are also classes you can take to develop hard and soft project management skills. Though you no longer need certifications in order to be considered a project manager, the Project Management Institute (PMI) offers courses, learning events, and their famous Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) , which was the first project management guide ever published. Finally, once you’ve selected a project management tool , you can also take their classes to learn technical project management skills. At Asana, we’ve developed the Asana Academy and How to Asana series to help new project managers learn new soft, hard, and technical skills. If you manage a project, you’re a project manager—and you likely already have some key project management skills. The most important thing is to be intentional, listen to your team, and collaborate with your team members. The rest will follow. Project management doesn’t need to be complex. Asana was designed specifically to keep project manager’s organized, with tools, automations, and customizations built for collaborating and coordinating everything from a simple brainstorming session to a full-fledged product launch.

More however, there are multiple factors at play that can influence your salary potential. getty The project management industry is witnessing unprecedented growth, and is set to increase in demand over the next few years, with a predicted 25 million needed to fill the gap across various industries globally. Some of the most popular sectors with opportunities for project managers include technology, construction, manufacturing, and finance. This comes at a time when the technology sector is booming, with AI spurring the need for over 90 million new jobs . It turns out that roles requiring project management skills and capabilities such as people management, stakeholder management and engagement, budgeting, project planning, and resource management are becoming more of a necessity for most organizations. And in tandem with this demand, the median salary for project practitioners in the U.S. is $120,000, up from $115,000 in 2021, according to the Project Management Institute's (PMI) findings . Which Countries Offer The Highest Salaries For Project Managers? According to PMI's report, the U.S., Australia, Germany, United Kingdom, and Singapore turn out to be in the list of the top five countries offering the most promising salaries for PM professionals. The rate of increase dramatically varies across countries, however, with Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and The United Arab Emirates, witnessing increases of more than 60%. But living and working in the right country is only part of the answer. As a general rule, you need to fulfill a few key criteria before you can expect to make six figures in this profession. Some of the other factors that affect your salary are outlined below: Factors That Influence Earning Potential To build and continue to grow your career as a project manager, you need to first bear in mind that a continuous growth mindset is key to your career success. Any management profession demands some aspect of PM skills, but if you are working specifically as a project manager, you will be expected to be versatile, adapt, plan for the worst, and coordinate multiple aspects while keeping projects or programs running smoothly. In our technically enhanced economy, you'll need to work on adopting new skill sets , such as proficiency in emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, automation, and data analytics. Therefore, ongoing industry awareness is key to your career success and salary increase. Continuous learning So it's no wonder that continuous learning and development, specifically for project management practice, played a key role in influencing some of the highest wage earners surveyed by PMI, who reported that obtaining a PMP certification helped them earn more in their roles. Some other project management certifications you can obtain include Prince2 Foundation and Practitioner, Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), and Six Sigma Green Belt and Black Belt. Project size and sector The scope and budget of a project, and the type of sector you're operating in, can significantly impact earning potential. For example, a multi-million-dollar government project would pay significantly more than a nonprofit working with a half-million-dollar budget. Experience The number of years of experience you have in project management is a directly contributing factor to your earning potential. As you increase in years of experience, in project size, and in your qualifications, your pay will show for it. For example, a project manager in the United States with less than three years of experience could make on average $78,279, while those with up to 10 years of experience can earn around $100,000 annually. While industries and sectors are evolving and demand increases for project managers in various capacities, this is the perfect time to jump into the industry if you haven't already. Contribute to the economy and experience a thrilling and rewarding career by obtaining your certifications so you can have a competitive edge, and build your experience both in and outside of work so you have a portfolio of successful projects to showcase your expertise.\"}, {'title': 'Global Demand for Project Management Professionals: A Career Pivot ...', 'url': 'https://www.projectmanagerlab.com/post/why-25-million-new-project-management-professionals-will-be-needed-by-2030', 'content': 'The global demand for project managers is skyrocketing.

Top Cities where KnowledgeHut Conduct Project Management Certification Training Course Online The 6 Benefit of Project Management Industries The stellar benefits of exceptional project management can be enlisted as follows: 1. Step towards better business decisions With clear documentation of a project’s progress, the management understands where the resources are being spent, how well utilized or wasted, areas that need prioritization, the chances of going off track, and how to avert them. Flawless project management forecasts issues before they show up, arrests bottlenecks, and makes faster and smarter data-driven decisions. 2. Finer Project management yields superior projects A survey reports that 80% of people spend nearly half their work time on rework. An immense loss of manhour and energy. Proper project planning is a way, rather than the only way out. Because it ensures: Right stakeholder alignment from the onset helps in minimizing needless pushback, sets the scope of a project, removes ambiguity, ensures everyone is on the same platform of awareness, and gives all involved a clear idea of what is expected to prevent mishaps. Flagging of the risks in advance with the signs to ‘watch out for like a budget overspent warning or something going off track. Ensures that each project has a strategic goal and that all stakeholders are aware of the same. Project leniency instead of making a water-tight compartment leaving no room for any change, thereby helping to remain prepared for the unexpected. Learn finer project management by working on industry-grade projects and by attending an online PMP course from a distinguished institution. 3. Shields wastage of time and money Effective project planning methods ensure the work is finished within budget and on time by mapping the entire project journey right from the outset with the milestones to achieve, risks to mitigate, resources to optimize, and expenses to incur to avoid delays and project overspending. According to PMI findings, 9.9% of every dollar spent gets wasted due to substandard project performance, which approximates $99 million for every $1 invested! 4. Strategic alignment with the business goal “If your organization is not good at project management, you’re putting too much at risk in terms of ultimately delivering on strategy,” says Mark Langley, the president and CEO of PMI. Project managers oversee the planning and execution of a project, ensuring the overall goal of a project and its subsequent tasks and milestones all align with the business goals. Such strategic alignment is required at every level of a project because it keeps all stakeholders on the same page and ensures the project initiatives drive the business forward. 5. Quality control A project might have fulfilled all the parameters of time and budget, but in the end, if the quality parameters are not met, the project is bound to be a disaster, which is not uncommon. Here is where the role of an efficient project manager is best felt and realized. Someone who defines the expected quality parameters ensures all involved in the project lifecycle are aware of the same and finally ensures that those are strictly followed at each step. 6. Set SMART goals Skillful project management sets SMART goals that are, Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-Bound. An efficient project manager defines each of these parameters set against the backdrop of business goals to ensure that the project objectives are attained within a certain time frame. The cost estimation, resource, and risk management factors are kept in mind throughout the process. In the context of the best industries for project managers, such as technology, construction, and healthcare, this method ensures accurate cost estimation, resource management, and risk mitigation. By focusing on realistic and achievable targets, project managers can prevent overestimation of deliverables and underestimation of costs, which are common causes of project failure.\"}]"

SHRM surveyed over 2,000 HR professionals earlier this year, and 69% reported difficulty recruiting for their full-time positions over the last 12 months. That’s down from 77% last year and steeply down from a high of 91% in 2022. “It’s not surprising that recruiting is still difficult and retention is improving,” said Jim Link, SHRM-SCP, chief human resources officer at SHRM. “Organizations are responding to what is happening in the greater economic environment. It is still hard to find key skilled talent. Those people are parking themselves in their current jobs. But the real story is: Are they actually engaged? I think the challenge for HR is to ensure that the people they are retaining are engaged, productive, and learning.” Business executives are nervous about the economy right now, agreed Tim Sackett, SHRM-SCP, industry veteran and author of The Talent Fix Volume 2 (SHRM, 2024). “Companies are holding onto their money and not really spending. Some companies over-hired in recent years and are thinking instead of cutting the fat and tightening up hiring,” he said. Adam Stafford, CEO of recruitment marketing and analytics platform Recruitics, said that the barrage of policy changes coming out of the new Trump administration is also causing hesitancy among employers. “Parts of the labor market will be significantly impacted by immigration restrictions and heightened immigration enforcement , driving up competition for lower-skilled labor and increasing pressure on wages later this year,” he said. “The impact from tariffs is uncertain but will affect some industries more than others. On the other hand, the federal workforce cuts can be an opportunity for the private sector to scoop up quality talent in certain fields, like cleared professionals, data science, and health care.” Meanwhile, the pressure to become more productive continues to mount, Stafford said. “The years since the post-pandemic recovery and rightsizing has shown that even companies conducting layoffs are also investing in new talent that is directly related to what they see as being strategic for the future of their business. While recruiting teams have been constrained, the volume of requisitions and applicants to handle has been rising.” Recruitment Challenges Among those experiencing difficulties in recruiting, top challenges include a low number of applicants (51%), competition from other employers (50%), and candidates ghosting (41%). Employers also cite candidates not having the right work experience or skills and the inability to offer flexible work or more competitive compensation as major hurdles to recruitment. “When I talk to senior TA [talent acquisition] executives, it’s still ‘We can’t find enough of the right talent for us,’ ” Sackett said. “It’s not that people aren’t out there. Applicant tracking data shows that the amount of applies per position has increased. There are a lot more resumes to plow through, but if you’re in manufacturing, or the skilled trades, or engineering, certain positions are still critically hard to fill. That’ll continue to be the case with low unemployment.” Jamie Kohn, senior research director at Gartner, said that an ongoing challenge is the need for recruiting to be a lot more efficient. “Leaders have been pushing hard for the efficiency of the recruiting function, but cost pressures are going to continue, particularly if we go into an economic downturn.” Candidates have been declining offers and remaining uncommitted to new roles, even as the labor market cools, Kohn said. “Candidates are nervous right now. Nobody wants to be last in and first out at a new organization. People are only jumping if they feel the offer is really compelling. And it’s a lot harder for companies to make high salary offers right now, like we saw a couple of years ago.” Even amidst the uncertainty, employers should be thinking about the next hiring rebound and not be caught unawares. “There will be a return to normalcy,” said Jake Zabkowicz, global CEO at Hudson RPO. “Attrition will normalize, and TA needs to continue to innovate. Don’t get caught on your heels. Start thinking about what your hiring volumes will be.” He recommended that employers focus on internal mobility — which involves identifying internal talent based on their skill sets and matching them to open roles — and develop returnship or boomerang programs targeting previous employees who would make great rehires. Earn Your SHRM Talent Acquisition Specialty Credential Skills Evolution SHRM found that over 25% of organizations have positions they’re hiring for that require new skills and that it’s been somewhat (67%) or very (12%) difficult to find qualified candidates for open positions requiring these skills. The skills reported to be in the highest demand are basic skills (58%), followed by more complex skills (36%), social skills (36%), and technical skills (28%). “Skills are evolving fast,” Kohn said. “We are seeing a major shift in the skills that organizations think they are going to need. AI is creating a shift in how we think about what skills are critical for a job versus where you just need to be conversant in a skill. At the same time, some things are not changing. We need people who are strong problem-solvers, who can collaborate, who can learn new skills.” These types of skills, often referred to as soft skills, are the power skills that get work done behind the scenes, Link explained. “The ability to communicate, negotiate, persuade, influence, collaborate, to have an innovative mindset, to be entrepreneurial,” he said. “These skills are much harder to assess, and they are harder to replicate through technology. HR will need to lead an equal measure of upskilling on both technical and power skills.” Kohn recommended that employers focus on a narrower set of critical roles or capabilities tied to the business road map instead of trying to map all the skills for all of the roles in the organization. “The minute you finish that, it’s already out of date,” she said. “If you look at the business strategy and a smaller number of critical roles, it becomes a lot easier.” AI Adoption Forty-three percent of respondents to the SHRM survey said that they use AI to support HR work, with the majority using the technology for recruiting. More specifically, they use AI tools to generate job descriptions, review or screen applicant resumes, and automate candidate searches. Nearly 90% of those who do use an AI tool say it saves them time and/or increases their efficiency. SHRM Members-Only Content: Using Artificial Intelligence for Employment Purposes “AI is here to stay,” Zabkowicz said. “There’s a lot of great technology out there that is improving the candidate experience and the hiring team’s experience. Many companies are still trying to figure out where to embed AI in their TA ecosystem. Each organization needs to find a tool that really sticks and shows quantifiable results.” AI is making the biggest difference right now in the early hiring funnel process, Stafford said. “AI can take what is a pretty antiquated process of humans screening and assessing applicants and scheduling interviews and make a big impact in helping evaluate and prioritize talent early in the hiring process.” He added that customers are reporting reductions in time-to-interview and improvements in candidate quality and experience. “We’re also seeing our clients amplify the impact of their ad spend and reduce the need to advertise by implementing AI-powered solutions at that point of initial interaction with candidates.” Kohn said that AI-enabled sourcing has the potential to overcome the challenge of searching for talent with niche skills. “Candidates are not always good at articulating the skills they have, and recruiters aren’t always good at understanding where a candidate may have high-value adjacent skills,” she said. “AI can infer the skills a candidate might have and match them up to multiple roles in the organization.” Screening is another area where AI has made a lot of early progress. “The standard now is a recruiter looks at a fraction of the applications or resumes that come in, and screens another fraction of those, and then sends a few to a hiring manager,” Sackett said. “Most candidates by far never even get a look. An AI screener can include 100% of applicants in the initial screen. When you talk about inclusivity or hiring more effectively from a larger pool of talent, that’s your solution.” Work Flex A significant gap exists between employee expectations and employer practices regarding work flexibility, with recruiters feeling the pain when they can’t offer hybrid or remote work options . Offering flexible work is the most effective recruitment tactic, according to the SHRM survey, but one of the least used. “Return-to-office [RTO] is a topic of conversation everywhere,” Zabkowicz said. “One argument is that if everyone is back in the office, you can see productivity and hold people more accountable. But the COVID years taught us that there are many roles for which you can have a flexible working environment and still maintain productivity.” But certainly, the access to talent would be unconstrained if recruiters offered flexible work, he said. “RTO policies are often made without the input of talent acquisition,” Kohn said. “TA leaders know they can attract better talent and have more sourcing options if they are able to offer remote work. Candidates still prioritize flexibility, but they realize there is less access to it than before. Flexibility when you work tends to be more important than flexibility in where you work,” she said. Stafford sees the RTO discussion break down by job level. “The companies that invest heavily in hiring and training entry-level talent are more likely to require in-office work. The benefits of being in the office are not as strong for more senior-level employees. The result is that those just entering the workforce will have a harder time finding fully remote work, and those senior-level professionals, especially in high-demand fields, will continue to find companies making accommodations for remote work because it has proven to be effective.”'}, {'title': 'Talent Acquisition Challenges and How to Overcome Them 2025 - Salary.com', 'url': 'https://www.salary.com/resources/hr-glossary/talent-acquisition-challenges-and-how-to-overcome-them-2025', 'content': \"Learn the common talent acquisition challenges, how to overcome them, and the importance of effective recruitment. Talent acquisition is an ongoing strategy for attracting and retaining high quality employees. Its core responsibility is to create a robust talent pipeline, strengthen the employer brand, and acquire the right candidates for the company’s needs. In 2025, a report suggests that 74% of employers are having a hard time finding skilled talents worldwide, and 71% in the United States. This scarcity is a testament to the talent acquisition challenges over the years. To mitigate these effects in the corporate industry, read on as we discuss the common talent acquisition challenges, how to overcome them, and the importance of having effective recruiting strategies. Common talent acquisition challenges Challenges in talent acquisition can be derived from different aspects like a complex process, shortage in qualifications, and the current job market. These hiring challenges impose a threat in maintaining the healthy cycle of talent management. One way to alleviate talent acquisition challenges is to use a tool that provides real-time insights in hiring and market trends. Real-time Job Posting Salary Data Solution can help you attract and retain the best talents through data-based decisions. To give you an overview, here are the common talent acquisition challenges that hiring managers usually face: Lengthy hiring processes According to a study, vacant positions in an organization costs an average of $500 per day as lost productivity. The longer process indicates that there might not be enough qualified candidates, or the best-fit ones have already hopped on to other job postings. Skills gap in candidates In the recruiting process, there will be candidates who lack the qualifications. Having a shortage of skilled job seekers means struggling to acquire candidates for critical roles. This will prolong the vacancies in those positions and affect how the company performance plays out. Personal biases Personal biases result in the struggle of acquiring diverse candidates and cultivating an inclusive working space . Bias can begin in initial screenings, like dismissing resumes due to gender, age, or race. In a recent survey, 80% of respondents think that inclusivity is important in hiring. Competition for talent Talent acquisition has a growing competition in today's job market . There is a high demand for skilled employees, and bigger corporations with more resources tend to attract and retain more talents than smaller companies. Candidate experience A candidate's dissatisfaction can influence their vigor to go to the next level with the company, which threatens the acquisition of the right candidates. Some of the things that discourage even the best talents are lukewarm interactions and poor communication with recruiters. Recruitment cost One of the challenges in talent acquisition is to come up with a cost-effective strategy that both attract the right talents and spend a reasonable amount of funds. Based on statistics, companies spend $98 per day to keep a job open and $4,683 to hire a new employee. Passive candidates Passive candidates are those who are not actively applying for a position but are open to good opportunities. With the right skills and qualifications, they are hard to recruit since they are either contacted by other recruiters or content with their current job roles. Importance of an effective talent acquisition An effective talent acquisition is key to attracting and keeping top talents. Here is a list of its importance: More access to top talents. You will attract the best candidates because of improved company branding and an optimized hiring process. More productivity. Vacant roles will be filled, which lessens the downtime of operations and improves the company’s performance. More diversity. There will be inclusivity in the workplace since objective recruitment is encouraged in effective talent acquisition. More employee retention. Employees will stay in an organization that keeps on advancing towards talent satisfaction and management. Less hiring costs. Since the recruitment process is streamlined, time and resources will be spent effectively. Having a talent acquisition strategy that reflects market conditions and evolving employer needs is an advantage. Real-time Job Posting Salary Data Solution can help you reduce hiring costs and expand access to top talents through insights backed by millions of datasets. How to overcome talent acquisition challenges Challenges in talent acquisition are not dead ends. Like every hiccup in the industry, it has solutions and alternatives. Here are ways your company can overcome talent acquisition challenges: Establish a strong employer brand According to statistics, 72% of recruiting leaders worldwide believed that having a robust brand can influence hiring. A strong company brand is attractive in the eyes of top talents. Here are some ways you can create one: Be more active on social media platforms. Incorporate employee testimonials in your website. Build an accessible and comprehensive career page. Streamline talent acquisition team Hiring teams are the first contact of candidates so they must know what they are doing. They need to effectively communicate and deliberately evaluate talents. To provide a good experience for candidates, the hiring team must: Act and respond fast to not lose top talents.

                "content": "You are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity."

The order and dignity of such a state was intended to provide a notable contrast with the unreasonable polity of Christian Europe, divided by self-interest and greed for power and riches, which More then described in Book I, written in England in 1516. The description of Utopia is put in the mouth of a mysterious traveler, Raphael Hythloday, in support of his argument that communism is the only cure against egoism in private and public life. More, in the dialogue , speaks in favour of mitigation of evil rather than cure, human nature being fallible. The reader is thus left guessing as to which parts of the brilliant jeu d’esprit are seriously intended and which are mere paradox . Speculative and practical utopias Written utopias may be speculative, practical, or satirical. Utopias are far older than their name. Plato ’s Republic was the model of many, from More to H.G. Wells . A utopian island occurs in the Hiera anagraphe (“Sacred Inscription”) of Euhemerus (flourished c. 300 bce ), and Plutarch (46–after 119 ce ), in his life of Lycurgus , describes a utopian Sparta . The legend of Atlantis inspired many utopian myths , but explorations in the 15th century permitted more realistic settings, and More himself associated Utopia with Amerigo Vespucci . Other utopias that were similar to More’s in humanist themes were the I mondi (1552) of Antonio Francesco Doni and La città felice (1553) of Francesco Patrizi. An early practical utopia was the comprehensive La città del sole (c. 1602; “The City of the Sun”) of Tommaso Campanella . Francis Bacon ’s New Atlantis (1627) was practical in its scientific program but speculative concerning philosophy and religion . Christian utopian commonwealths were described in Antangil (1616) by “I.D.M.,” Christianopolis (1619) by Johann Valentin Andreae, and Novae Solymae libri sex (1648) by Samuel Gott. Puritanism produced many literary utopias, both religious and secular , notably The Law of Freedom… (1652), in which Gerrard Winstanley advocated the principles of the Diggers . The Common-Wealth of Oceana (1656) by James Harrington argued for the distribution of land as the condition of popular independence. In France such works as Gabriel de Foigny’s Terre australe connue (1676) preached liberty. François Fénelon ’s Télémaque (1699) contained utopian episodes extolling the simple life. L’An 2440 by Louis-Sébastien Mercier (1770; Eng. trans., 1772) anticipated Revolutionary doctrines. G.A. Ellis’s New Britain (1820) and Étienne Cabet ’s Voyage en Icarie (1840) were related to experimental communities in the United States that revealed the limitations of purely economic planning . Consequently, Bulwer-Lytton , in The Coming Race (1871), invented an essence that eliminated economics altogether, and William Morris demonstrated his contempt for economics in News from Nowhere (1890). Two influential utopias, however, had an economic basis: Looking Backward, 2000–1887 (1888) by Edward Bellamy and Freiland (1890; A Visit to Freeland… ) by Theodor Herzka. H.G. Wells , in A Modern Utopia (1905), returned to speculation.'}, {'title': 'Utopia - New World Encyclopedia', 'url': 'https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Utopia', 'content': 'Left panel ( The Earthly Paradise , Garden of Eden), from Hieronymus Bosch\\'s The Garden of Earthly Delights . This artist showed in his paintings part of the desires that induce human beings in pursuit of a heaven on earth. Utopia is a term denoting a visionary or ideally perfect state of society, whose members live the best possible life. The term “Utopia” was coined by Thomas More from the Greek words ou (no or not), and topos (place), as the name for the ideal state in his book, De optimo reipublicae statu deque nova insula Utopia (Louvain, 1516). Utopianism refers to the various ways in which people think about, depict, and attempt to create a perfect society. Utopian thought deals with morality , ethics , psychology , and political philosophy , and often originates from the belief that reason and intelligence can bring about the betterment of society. It is usually characterized by optimism that an ideal society is possible. Utopianism plays an important role in motivating social and political change. The adjective \"utopian\" is sometimes used in a negative connotation to discredit ideas as too advanced, too optimistic or unrealistic and impossible to realize. The term “Utopian” has also been used to describe actual communities founded in attempts to create an ideal economic and political system. Many works of utopian literature offer detailed and practical descriptions of an ideal society, but usually include some fatal flaw that makes the establishment of such a society impossible. More\\'s Utopia Woodcut by Ambrosius Holbein for the 1518 edition of Thomas More\\'s Utopia The term “Utopia” was coined by Thomas More from the Greek words ou (no or not), and topos (place), as the name for the ideal state in his book, De optimo reipublicae statu deque nova insula Utopia ( Utopia Louvain, 1516). The book is narrated by a Portuguese traveler named Raphael Hythlodaeus, who criticizes the laws and customs of European states while admiring the ideal institutions which he observes during a five year sojourn on the island of Utopia. Did you know? The term “Utopia” was coined by Thomas More as the name for the ideal state in his book, \"Utopia,\" which described a fictional perfect society Utopia is a perfect society, where poverty and misery have been eliminated, there are few laws and no lawyers , and the citizens, though ready to defend themselves if necessary, are pacifists . Citizens hold property in common, and care is taken to teach everyone a trade from which he can make a living, so that there is no need for crime. Agriculture is treated as a science and taught to children as part of their school curriculum; every citizen spends some of his life working on a farm. The people live in 54 cities, separated from each other by a distance of at least 24 miles. The rural population lives in communal farmhouses scattered through the countryside. Everyone works only six hours a day; this is sufficient because the people are industrious and do not require the production of useless luxuries for their consumption. A body of wise and educated representatives deliberates on public affairs, and the country is governed by a prince, selected from among candidates chosen by the people. The prince is elected for life, but can be removed from office for tyranny. All religions are tolerated and exist in harmony; atheism is not permitted since, if a man does not fear a god of some kind, he will commit evil acts and weaken society. Utopia rarely sends its citizens to war , but hires mercenaries from among its warlike neighbors, deliberately sending them into danger in the hope that the more belligerent populations of all surrounding countries will be gradually eliminated. Utopia was first published in Louvain in 1516, without More’s knowledge, by his friend Erasmus . It was not until 1551, sixteen years after More\\'s execution as a traitor, that it was first published in England as an English translation. Although some readers have regarded Utopia as a realistic blueprint for a working nation, More likely intended it as a satire , allowing him to call attention to European political and social abuses without risking censure by the king. The similarities to the ideas later developed by Karl Marx are evident, but More was a devout Roman Catholic and probably used monastic communalism as his model. The politics of Utopia have been seen as influential to the ideas of Anabaptism, Mormonism , and communism . An applied example of More\\'s utopia can be seen in Vasco de Quiroga\\'s implemented society in Michoacán, Mexico , which was directly taken and adapted from More\\'s work. Utopian Literature The word “utopia” overtook More\\'s short work and has been used ever since to describe any type of imaginary ideal society. Although he may not have founded the genre of utopian and dystopian fiction, More certainly popularized it. Some of the early works which owe something to Utopia include The City of the Sun by Tommaso Campanella , Description of the Republic of Christianopolis by Johannes Valentinus Andreae, New Atlantis by Francis Bacon and Candide by Voltaire . The more modern genre of science fiction frequently depicts utopian or dystopian societies in fictional works such as Aldous Huxley \\'s Brave New World (1932) Lost Horizon by James Hilton (1933), \"A Modern Utopia\" (1905) and New Worlds for Old (1908) by H. G. Wells , The Great Explosion by Eric Frank Russell (1963), News From Nowhere by William Morris , Andromeda Nebula (1957) by Ivan Efremov, 1984 (1949) by George Orwell , and The Giver (1993) by Lois Lowry. Authors of utopian fiction are able to explore some of the problems raised by utopian concepts and to develop interesting consequences. Many works make use of an outsider, a time-traveler or a foreigner, who observes the features of the society and describes them to the reader. Utopianism Utopian thought is born from the premise that through reason and intelligence , humankind is capable of creating an ideal society in which every individual can achieve fulfillment without infringing on the happiness and well-being of the other members of society. It includes the consideration of morality , ethics , psychology , and social and political philosophy . Utopian thinking is generally confined to physical life on earth, although it may include the preparation of the members of society for a perceived afterlife . It invariably includes criticism of the current state of society and seeks ways to correct or eliminate abuses. Utopianism is characterized by tension between philosophical ideals and the practical realities of society, such as crime and immorality; there is also a conflict between respect for individual freedom and the need to maintain order. Utopian thinking implies a creative process that challenges existing concepts, rather than an ideology or justification for a belief system which is already in place. Two of Plato ’s dialogues, Republic and Laws , contain one of the earliest attempts to define a political organization that would not only allow its citizens to live in harmony, but would also provide the education and experience necessary for each citizen to realize his highest potential. During the nineteenth century, thinkers such as Henri Saint-Simon , Charles Fourier , and Etienne Cabet in France, and Robert Owen in England popularized the idea of creating small, experimental communities to put philosophical ideals into practice. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels recognized that utopianism offered a vision for a better future, a vision that contributed much to Marxism, but they also criticized utopian writers\\' lack of a wider understanding of social and political realities which could contribute to actual political change. Herbert Marcuse made a distinction between “abstract” utopias based on fantasy and dreams, and “concrete” utopias based on critical social theory. Utopianism is considered to originate in the imaginative capacity of the subconscious mind, which is able to transcend conscious reality by projecting images of hopes, dreams, and desires. Utopian ideas, though they may never be fully realized, play an important role in bringing about positive social change. They allow thinkers to distance themselves from the existing reality and consider new possibilities. The optimism that a better society can be achieved provides motivation and a focal point for those involved in bringing about social or political change. Abolitionism , women’s rights and feminism , the Civil Rights movement , the establishment of a welfare system to take care of the poor, the Red Cross , and multiculturalism are all examples of utopian thinking applied to practical life. Types of Utopia Economic Utopias The harsh economic conditions of the nineteenth century and the social disruption created by the development of commercialism and capitalism led several writers to imagine economically utopian societies. Some were characterized by a variety of socialist ideas: an equal distribution of goods according to need, frequently with the total abolition of money ; citizens laboring for the common good; citizens doing work which they enjoyed; and ample leisure time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One such utopia was described in Edward Bellamy\\'s Looking Backward . Another socialist utopia was William Morris \\' News from Nowhere , written partially in criticism of the bureaucratic nature of Bellamy\\'s utopia. Capitalist utopias, such as the one portrayed in Robert A. Heinlein \\'s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress or Ayn Rand ’s The Fountainhead , are generally individualistic and libertarian, and are based on perfect market economies, in which there is no market failure. Eric Frank Russell\\'s book The Great Explosion (1963) details an economic and social utopia, the first to mention of the idea of Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS). Political and Historical Utopias Political utopias are ones in which the government establishes a society that is striving toward perfection. These utopias are based on laws administered by a government, and often restrict individualism when it conflicts with the primary goals of the society. Sometimes the state or government replaces religious and family values. A global utopia of world peace is often seen as one of the possible inevitable ends of history. Religious Utopia Through history a number of religious communities have been created to reflect the virtues and values they believe have been lost or which await them in the Afterlife . In the United States and Europe during and after the Second Great Awakening of the nineteenth century, many radical religious groups sought to form communities where all aspects of people\\'s lives could be governed by their faith. Among the best-known of these utopian societies were the Puritans, and the Shaker movement, which originated in England in the eighteenth century but moved to America shortly after its founding. The most common utopias are based on religious ideals, and usually required adherence to a particular religious tradition. The Jewish , Christian and Islamic concepts of the Garden of Eden and Heaven may be interpreted as forms of utopianism, especially in their folk-religious forms. Such religious \"utopias\" are often described as \"gardens of delight,\" implying an existence free from worry in a state of bliss or enlightenment. They postulate existences free from sin, pain, poverty and death, and often assume communion with beings such as angels or the houri . In a similar sense the Hindu concept of Moksha and the Buddhist concept of Nirvana may be thought of as a kind of utopia. Many cultures and cosmogonies include a myth or memory of a distant past when humankind lived in a primitive and simple state of perfect happiness and fulfillment. The various myths describe a time when there was an instinctive harmony between man and nature, and man’s needs were easily supplied by the abundance of nature. There was no motive for war or oppression, or any need for hard and painful work. Humans were simple and pious, and felt themselves close to the gods. These mythical or religious archetypes resurge with special vitality during difficult times, when the myth is not projected towards the remote past, but towards the future or a distant and fictional place (for example, The Land of Cockaygne , a straightforward parody of a paradise), where the possibility of living happily must exist. Golden Age The Golden Age by Lucas Cranach the Elder Works and Days , compilation of the mythological tradition by the Greek poet Hesiod , around the eighth century B.C.E. , explained that, prior to the present era, there were four progressively most perfect ones. A medieval poem (c. 1315) , entitled \" The Land of Cokaygne \" depicts a land of extravagance and excess where cooked larks flew straight into one\\'s mouth; the rivers ran with wine, and a fountain of youth kept everyone young and active. Far in the sea, to the west of Spain, Is a country called Cokaygne. :There\\'s no land not anywhere, In goods or riches to compare. Though Paradise be merry and bright Cokaygne is of far fairer sight.... Scientific and Technological Utopias Scientific and technical utopias are set in the future, when it is believed that advanced science and technology will allow utopian living standards; for example, the absence of death and suffering; changes in human nature and the human condition. These utopian societies tend to change what \"human\" is all about. Normal human functions, such as sleeping, eating and even reproduction are replaced by artificial means. Related Terms Dystopia is a negative utopia: a world wherein utopian ideals have been subverted. Examples include George Orwell \\'s 1984 and Aldous Huxley \\'s Brave New World . Eutopia is a positive utopia, roughly equivalent to the regular use of the word \"utopia.\" Heterotopia , the \"other place,\" with its real and imagined possibilities (a mix of \"utopian\" escapism and turning virtual possibilities into reality)—example: cyberspace . Samuel R. Delany\\'s novel Trouble on Triton is subtitled An Ambiguous Heterotopia to highlight that it is not strictly utopian (though certainly not dystopian). The novel offers several conflicting perspectives on the concept of utopia. Ourtopia combines the English \\'our\\' with the Greek \\'topos\\' to give \\'our place\\'—the nearest thing to a utopian planet that is actually attainable. Examples of Utopias Plato\\'s Republic (400 B.C.E. ) was, at least on one level, a description of a political utopia ruled by an elite of philosopher-kings, conceived by Plato (compare to his Laws , discussing laws for a real city). ( Plato’s Republic at Project Gutenberg ) The City of God , (written 413–426) by Augustine of Hippo , describes an ideal city, the “eternal” Jerusalem , the archetype of all “Christian” utopias. Utopia (1516) by Thomas More ( Full text available from Project Gutenberg ) Reipublicae Christianopolitanae descriptio ( Beschreibung des Staates Christenstadt ) (1619) by Johann Valentin Andrea describes a Christian religious utopia inhabited by a community of scholar-artisans and run as a democracy. The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) by Robert Burton, a utopian society is described in the preface. The City of the Sun (1623) by Tommaso Campanella depicts a theocratic and communist society. The New Atlantis (1627) by Francis Bacon Oceana (1656) the Integral, praising the efficiency, the rationality, and the happiness that life within the confines of the One State can bring to those worlds the Integral will someday visit. William Morris ’ News From Nowhere describes a utopian England that has deindustrialized and returned to a cooperative pastoral lifestyle. Looking Backward (1888) by Edward Bellamy. New Australia was a utopian movement founded in 1893 in Paraguay by William Lane. Aldous Huxley \\'s Brave New World (1932) can be considered an example of pseudo-utopian satire. One of his other books, Island (1962), demonstrates a positive utopia. Shangri-La , described in the novel Lost Horizon by James Hilton (1933) Islandia (1942), by Austin Tappan Wright , an imaginary island in the Southern Hemisphere containing many Arcadian elements, including a rejection of technology. B. F. Skinner \\'s Walden Two (1948) The Cloud of Magellan (1955) a communistic Utopian future by Stanisław Lem Andromeda Nebula (1957) is a classic communist utopia by Ivan Efremov In The Great Explosion by Eric Frank Russell (1963), the last section sets out a workable utopian economic system leading to a different social and political reality.

Then you\\'ve thought about a utopia. This word actually came from literature when Sir Thomas More used the word utopia to describe the perfect island. Get a clear idea of what a utopia is and see several utopia examples. When you think of the perfect world, you might think of heaven or a world with no wars. Several writers and philosophers have tried to imagine the perfect world. But by definition, the term utopia refers to an ideal or place in which all aspects are perfect or nearly so. So, where did utopia come from? Sir Thomas More created the concept name in 1516 as the title of his book, Utopia . Within his book, More created a fictional description of an island that had the qualities of perfection. Since then, many writers and philosophers have tried to create a utopian society. However, most fictional utopias actually turn out to be a dystopia, an imaginary world with suffering and injustice. A prime example of a utopia that\\'s actually a dystopia is seen in George Orwell\\'s 19 84 . You can also view a dystopia in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World . Examples of utopia, in various contexts, as represented through literature, art, popular culture, and other means include: The Garden of Eden, an aesthetically pleasing place in which there was \"no knowledge of good and evil\" Heaven, a religious supernatural place where God, angels and human souls live in harmony Shangri-La, in James Hilton\\'s Lost Horizon, a mystical harmonious valley Tao Yuanming\\'s The Peach Blossom Spring, which describes a beautiful secluded community not affected by the rest of the world Ellis\\'s description in Specimens of Early English Poets of the Land of Cockaigne , a place where \"houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry\" The entire Golden A ge as described by Hesiod, a Greek poet The Federation in the Star Trek series The Capital in The Hunger Games series, a place of luxury and freedoms England in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World , a place with no wars or hunger but also no emotion The term utopia was originally a description of a social environment and has manifested in many ways. The idea of \"world peace\" is considered utopian in nature, and United States communes were attempts at utopian ways of living. However, there are several different features of an ideal society. In an ecological utopia, the society would work in harmony with the nature around them. Rather than producing waste and pollution, people would become one with nature to have ecological harmony. Utopian idealism took off after the 18th century. Those seeking economic utopia are partially responsible for the development of commercialism and capitalism, although they were combined with some socialist characteristics in the early 19th century. Much of the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was working toward a self-sustaining utopian economy. Religious utopias exist in concept, both as intra-religious ideals as well as inter-religious. In these types of societies, faith controls every aspect of a person\\'s life, creating religious harmony. For example, the Amish community works towards religious utopia. Scientific utopias pertain to the idea of perfection in terms of living standards. Means of attempting to achieve utopia through science include ideas that omit death and suffering from life or make the human condition perfect. Scientific and technological utopias are oftentimes connected. Technological utopian lifestyles would be those that replace human needs or functions with technology in such a way that humans have a higher quality of life. An example of a technology utopia is Francis Bacon\\'s New Atlantis . You have seen many different examples of utopia, so it\\'s easy to imagine your own utopia by thinking of your idea of the perfect society or the perfect world. Now that you’ve had a taste of utopia, check out examples of dystopia .'}, {'title': 'Utopia defined, utopian and dystopian literature examined, and utopian ...', 'url': 'https://www.britannica.com/summary/utopia', 'content': 'utopia , An ideal society whose inhabitants exist under seemingly perfect conditions. The word was coined by Sir Thomas More in his work Utopia (1516), which described a pagan and communist city-state whose institutions and policies were governed entirely by reason. Literary utopias are far older than their name. Plato ’s Republic was the model of many others, from More’s Utopia to H.G. Wells ’s A Modern Utopia (1905). Other literary utopias, such as Jonathan Swift ’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726), are satirical, their aim being to ridicule existent conditions. The related category of literary dystopias, depicting anti-utopian societies, includes 20th-century and later works, such as George Orwell ’s Nineteen Eighty-four (1949) and Ray Bradbury ’s Farenheit 451 (1953). Concurrent with utopian literature have been attempts by various religious leaders and political reformers to create actual utopian communities (especially in North America), such as New Harmony, founded (1825) in Indiana by Robert Owen , and Brook Farm, founded (1841) in Massachusetts by George Ripley, a follower of the French social theorist Charles Fourier. Most of those communities, however, were short-lived.'}, {'title': 'Utopias and Utopianism - Encyclopedia.com', 'url': 'https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/utopias-and-utopianism', 'content': 'UTOPIAS AND UTOPIANISM The word utopia was invented by Thomas More, who published his famous Utopia (in Latin) in 1516. More coupled the Greek words ou (no, or not) and topos (place) to invent a name that has since passed into nearly universal currency. Further verbal play shows the close relation between utopia and eutopia , which means \"the good [or happy] place.\" Through the succeeding centuries this double aspect has marked the core of utopian literature, which has employed the imaginary to project the ideal. (This is not to deny that More\\'s own attitude towards the ideal society he imagined may well have been ambivalent.) The words utopia and utopian, however, have been put to many uses besides the one suggested by More\\'s book. Common to all uses is reference to either the imaginary or the ideal, or to both. But sometimes the words are used as terms of derision and sometimes with a vagueness that robs them of any genuine usefulness. For example, a proposal that is farfetched or implausible is often condemned as utopian, whether or not the proposal has any idealistic content. In another, closely related pejorative use, utopian designates that which is unacceptably different from the customary or is radical in its demands. The connotation of impossibility or complete impracticality serves to discredit a threatening idealism. Similarly, daydreams and fantasies — psychologically driven and frequently bizarre expressions of private ideals — are called utopian, as if utopia were synonymous with deviant or deranged thinking. Even when the word is used without hostility, its coverage is enormously wide. Almost any expression of idealism — a view of a better life, a statement of basic political commitments, a plea for major reform in one or another sector of social life — can earn for itself the title utopian. Furthermore, all literary depictions of imaginary societies are called utopian, even if they are actually dystopias (bad places) that represent some totalitarian or fiendish horror, or are primarily futuristic speculations about technical and scientific possibilities that have no important connection to any idealism. Much historical experience is reflected in this variety of usage. Indeed, the ways in which utopia (and utopian) are used can be symptomatic of prevailing attitudes towards social change in general. Nevertheless, clarity could be served if we see the core of utopianism as speculation, in whatever literary form, about ideal societies and ideal ways of life for whole populations, in which perfection, defined in accordance with common prepossessions and not merely personal predilections, is aimed at. Perfection is conceived of as harmony, the harmony of each person with himself or herself and with the rest of society. (If there must always be war, then utopian war is waged only against outsiders.) The tradition of utopian thought, in this core sense, is thus made up of elaborated ideas, images, and visions of social harmony. Not discussed in this entry is dystopian speculation in many genres about the near or distant future, in which the condition of human life is degraded or deformed. In many cases, dystopia shares with utopia a total vision of an imaginary society; but a deliberate hell, not a planned heaven. What brings such a condition into being is zeal to maintain the power of the ruling group, not the project of human well-being. An oppressive and tenacious dictatorship holds sway. The most famous example is the sadistic dystopia of George Orwell \\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Inspiration of Utopianism The forerunners of the utopian tradition are the fables and myths of the golden age, the Garden of Eden , or some benign state of nature. These inherited stories, although of considerable antiquity, look back to some even more remote time in the misty past when harmony was allegedly the normal condition of life. Remorse or nostalgia is the usual accompaniment of these stories. Reality is not what it was, and worldly good sense holds that it is not likely that life will ever be again what it was — except perhaps through some divine intercession. An uncontrived harmony characterized the primal felicity. Simple people led lives as simple as themselves; because human nature was undeveloped, they were easily made content. If the glories and pleasures of civilization were missing, so were its artificialities, corruptions, and physical and psychological sufferings. Whenever disgust or disenchantment with civilization has become acute, these old stories are retold in order to expose the faults of civilization. But apart from their role in this fundamentally self-conscious method of striking at an existing order, these stories are primarily interesting as repositories of the age-old longings of ordinary humanity. All that the world is not is summed up in short and supposedly seductive descriptions. Sometime long ago, when people were still in touch with their uncontaminated nature, they lived without domination, irrational inequality, scarcity, brutalizing labor, warfare, and the tortures of conscience; they lived without disharmony in any form. The good life is, in the first instance, defined by the absence of these things. Although fondness for an early simplicity may seem regressive — an ignoble attachment to a primitive and subhuman harmony — a principal impetus for utopianism is undeniably to be found here. The later tradition not only fills out the picture that is only a sketch in the old myths, but more important, transcends the old myths. Whatever wistfulness for the golden age may be present, there is general agreement that primal harmony cannot be regained. The condition of harmony, which defines the good life, must be civilized. It may be more or less complex, more or less scientific, more or less abundant, more or less hierarchical, more or less free, but it must be organized and institutionally articulated (and almost always governed). Throughout the utopian tradition, reality is not defied to the extent of wishing away the idea of a settled society. In Plato\\'s Republic , Socrates can dwell only briefly on the excellence of an amiably anarchic rusticity (no war, no class-strife, no politics, no meat-eating, no philosophy or sciences or high art) before his admirer Glaucon, with the stinging phrase \"city of pigs,\" forces him to turn his thoughts to the ideal city (the city of justice, which is founded on the initial unjust act of taking land from others). This transition can be taken as typical of utopianism as a whole. Varieties of Utopianism Even with a scrupulous adherence to the definition of utopianism as the succession of ideas, images, and visions of social harmony, the relevant texts are extremely numerous. The main types of utopias include, first, and most properly utopian, descriptions of imaginary societies held to be perfect or much closer to perfection than any society in the real world. They are located in the past, present, or future and are contained in treatise, novel, story, or poem with varying degrees of detailed specification and imaginative inventiveness. The second type of utopia — closely allied to the first — is found in those works of political theory in which reflection on the fundamental questions of politics leads the theorist beyond politics to consider the social and cultural presuppositions of the ideal political order and the ends of life which that political order (placed in a certain social and cultural setting) can and should facilitate. Whereas the political theorist comes to the forms and purposes of all institutional life by way of political concerns and, as it were, incidentally, the intentionally utopian writer, with Thomas More as the model, works out from the start a comprehensive view of the ideal society and its way of life, a view in which political forms need not be of central importance. Some works of political theory — Plato\\'s Republic , for example — so capably discuss nonpolitical matters that they fit into either category. Those philosophies of history that culminate in a vision of achieved perfection are a third cluster of writings that are not imaginary projections of the ideal but display instead metaphysical optimism of a total kind. These are the theories of inevitable progress created by such thinkers as the Marquis de Condorcet, Herbert Spencer , and Karl Marx . Marx, for one, indignantly fought against inclusion in the utopian tradition because he presented himself as an antiutopian realist blessed with unique insight into the nature of the historical process and its necessary workings carried even to the future, not as an idealist preaching to the world an ahistorical conception of the ideal. For all that, others have taken his writings as belonging in the utopian tradition. Roughly, the same holds for Spencer and some other philosophers of history. No list of the major sources of utopian literature would be acceptable without theorists of inevitable progress. Fourth are those works — sometimes called philosophical anthropologies — in which the writer attempts not only to isolate the instincts, traits, and capacities that are peculiar to humanity among all species in nature, but also to specify what is genuinely human rather than merely conventional, and what human growth and fuller realization would be. These discourses are not always consciously utopian; they may be directed to individual reformation or to preparation for the afterlife. Furthermore, the discussion may be carried on without reference to concrete social practices and institutions. That is, philosophical anthropologies aim to assess the various kinds of human activity, the various pleasures open to human beings, or the various styles of life made possible by advancing civilization or cumulatively progressive science. A few examples are Schiller\\'s On the Aesthetic Education of Man (1795), Ernst Bloch \\'s The Principle of Hope (1955 – 1959), Herbert Marcuse \\'s Eros and Civilization (1955), and Norman O. Brown\\'s Love\\'s Body (1966). But despite the abstract quality of philosophical anthropology, and whatever the intentions of a given writer, it would be unduly constrictive to omit altogether this literature from an account of utopianism. When its idealism is manifest, philosophical anthropology is thus highly relevant to or allied with utopianism. In the fifth group are prophecies of profound alteration for the better in human existence made by religious groups, statements of purpose made by revolutionary groups, and blueprints offered by individuals, sects, and secular associations. Obviously, not all activist and reformist political and religious groups have sought to remake society completely, in conformity with the utopian aim of harmony. Nevertheless, many groups have not been satisfied merely to speculate about the ideal society but have sought to realize it, either by persuasion or violence. Examples are the sixteenth-century Anabaptist millenarian, or chiliastic, movements in Europe, radical Protestant groups in the English civil war in the middle of the seventeenth century, and some of the marginal radical figures in the French Revolution , such as Gracchus Babeuf. And in the nineteenth century, especially in the United States , small bands of eager people, religious or simply high-minded, formed utopian communities on unoccupied land, enclaves in isolation from the larger society. Some residues continued to exist after the nineteenth century. In the second half of the twentieth century, for example, a few communal utopian experiments in the United States were inspired by Walden Two (1948), the utopian novel by B. F. Skinner, a behavioral psychologist. Causes of Utopianism The literature of social harmony is thus extensive and diverse. Some periods and some cultures have been richer in utopianism than others. The question therefore arises as to why some persons become utopian in their thought or, more rarely, in their action. What causes the desire for change to be absolute, the character of idealism to be extreme and uncompromising, the passion for harmony so averse to the normal condition of dispute and dissonance? Several answers are found scattered in the history of utopianism; some indicate urgency, others do not. First, some intellectuals simply need to invent worlds. The construction of a utopia, even if only on paper, is a godlike act and resembles the creation of a fictional world by the nonutopian novelist. A utopia can thus be an effort at mastering the complexity of social phenomena; part of the effort consists of rearranging social phenomena to form a more rational or beautiful pattern. In short, one impulse that sustains utopianism, from Plato to the latest science fiction , is to give imagination free rein. This is serious intellectual playfulness. (The same could be said about philosophers of inevitable progress, howsoever they present their optimism.) Another cause is the desire for moral clarity. In the course of carrying one\\'s demands on social reality as far as possible, one may achieve a fixed — potentially rigid — position in relation to that reality. As a consequence, reality can be constantly put to the test. To the utopian writer, improvisation that allows purposes to emerge from the onrush of experience or waits for new means to suggest or impose new ends is nothing more than a passive or complacent or naive immersion in reality or a confused and unprepared reception of it. Although utopian writers may do nothing to improve society, they may still deem it worthwhile to preserve the concept of the ideal. This may be thought desirable even in comparatively decent societies; to insist on the distinction between the acceptable and the ideal can have a chastening influence on those who govern as well as on those who happily go along. The utopian writer in all varieties of utopianism promotes dissatisfaction and self-criticism, with the risk, of course, of simultaneously provoking a reinvigorated defense of the status quo. A further cause of utopian thought — and one that lacks the quality of comparative detachment present in the two preceding ones — is the wish to subject society to a total indictment. What is involved here is not a sense that things could be, or may always be, much better than they are but that everything, or nearly everything, is intolerable — inhumanly oppressive — and deserves to go under. There is the direct, unappeasable indictment of established institutions, the way of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his discourses, William Blake in some of his long poems, Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto , or D. H. Lawrence in his two books on the unconscious. In works of this sort hatred of social reality may be stronger than love of any alternative; the positive utopianism may be only implicit. Other works propose, in contrast, that existing social conditions are a spurious utopia: the mass pleasures, whether technological or licentious, provided by affluent society block the way to a genuine transformation of the human condition into a genuine utopia. Such was the theme of the Frankfurt School of social critique in the middle third of the twentieth century. The indictment of society is indirect when the utopianism is explicit and the practices of the ideal society are sketched. And because the main aim is to indict, the practices of the ideal society are, at least in large part, the contradiction of those in existence. The utopian imagination in these instances is hemmed in by the grave defects of the real world; the urge is strong to replace them by conditions that in no way resemble them or to discredit them intellectually. Utopian writing so motivated may blend into radical satire aimed at the status quo and produce a work as great as Jonathan Swift \\'s Gulliver\\'s Travels (1726). Or it may produce works such as William Morris \\'s News from Nowhere (1891) that are plainly archaistic and may expose themselves to the charge of immaturity or irrelevance. Almost all utopian works contain curiosities and excesses, which may often be explained as compensatory responses to especially terrible features of the real world. A similar cause of utopian thought is tactical. There are times when it may appear to those bent on reforming society that overstatement is necessary for some degree of success. That is, utopian works need not harbor utopian intentions or even an abstract utopian commitment. Although writers may lavish great energy on making their utopias plausible and attractive, they may aspire only to contribute to the gradual and partial amelioration of their societies. By painting fair pictures of felicity and suggesting that the world is, as presently made up, remote from that felicity, they may encourage an innovating spirit. At the same time, these utopias will give at least guidelines for reform. There may be no real expectation that the utopia will ever fully materialize or, indeed, that pure felicity can be had on any terms. Nevertheless, without that exaggeration, less-than-utopian reform would perhaps be too modest or too slow. Much depends on the persuasiveness of the writer\\'s scheme. For that reason the utopias of reform tend to be less free in their speculation and are content to suggest the completion of certain good tendencies in the real world rather than trying to overturn it theoretically. Edward Bellamy \\'s Looking Backward, 2000 – 1887 (1888) is an example of this tactic. The last cause of utopian thought is the most obvious — the conviction that the whole truth about human well-being in a setting of social harmony is known, can be imparted, and should be acted on. There is, of course, a wide variety in the historical situations that call forth such an overweening attitude. But if some radical Protestant groups (such as the German Anabaptists of the sixteenth century), some utopian movements of the nineteenth century (such as those inspired by the Comte de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier , and Robert Owen ), and those Marxists who are quasi-utopian are exemplary, there must be a sense of deep, intolerable wrong. There must also be a sense of enormous possibility, of not only righting the wrong but also going beyond to perfection itself, and either an overpowering group- or self-confidence or the conviction that the utopian leaders and their following are the instruments of some higher will or the culmination of some impersonal process. The word messianism perhaps best summarizes some manifestations of this utopian spirit. Uses of Utopianism Apart from their place in history, of what use are the works of utopianism? When utopian writings are deliberate constructions of whole societies, readers may think that utopianism is simply a scattering of uninhabited palaces — grand imaginary structures that may amuse realists if not filling them with contempt. But utopianism is more than its core, the deliberate constructions made by the imagination. The utopian aspiration is found in various modes of writing, and is sometimes oblique or even hidden. Is there, however, something of enduring value, in all these modes, even the deliberate constructions, apart from any question of application? There are, in fact, several benefits conferred by utopianism. As already noted, a cause of utopian writing is playful delight in the act of imagining new kinds of social reality. This delight can be answered by the pleasure the reader takes in the results of that playfulness. The standards for judging utopianism (in any of its modes) from this point of view are primarily aesthetic — plausible novelties in the projected way of life, clever and ingenious details, daring departures from customary practices. The inner coherence of the utopian ideal matters more than any closeness to probability, although naturally too much strain on belief weakens the pleasure. Admiration for the skill of the utopian writer may be mixed with appreciation for being allowed to contemplate what it would mean to live other lives. No stimulus to make one\\'s own better need be felt. This may make the utopian enterprise somewhat precious, but it can be a source of guiltless satisfaction even to the most conservative temperaments. The utopian works of H. G. Wells are famous for their power to gratify the taste for sampling different worlds, however else they may instruct. A second use of utopianism is as a record of human aspiration. For the record to be complete, many other kinds of utterance must be consulted, but the various modes of utopianism supply a valuable indication. They are peculiarly vivid forms taken by changeable human longings underlain by permanent human wants. Read with due allowance for their often lopsided or eccentric quality, they will shed vivid light on their times. The desperation of a given historical period, together with the limits of its hopefulness, may emerge from a study of its utopian writings. The abundance or paucity of utopian writing is itself an aid to understanding a period. Third is the contribution of several modes of utopian literature to general sociology. The great constructed utopias — Plato\\'s Republic and Laws , the relevant parts of Aristotle\\'s Politics , More\\'s Utopia , Tommaso Campanella \\'s The City of the Sun (1623), Morelly\\'s Code de la nature (1755), the writings of Saint-Simon and Fourier (early nineteenth century), H. G. Wells\\'s A Modern Utopia (1905) — incorporate a great deal of sociological wisdom. Common to these and other utopias is the idea of the integration of social institutions in its most intense version, utopian harmony. To utopian writers no habit or practice seems innocent of significance for the proper maintenance of the utopian society. Utopian writers are therefore constantly pointing out connections between things that appear unrelated. Part of utopian analysis consists in the attempt to identify the major elements of society and to demonstrate how they act on one another and how each must be adjusted to the others if the best possible world is to be attained. For all their care, utopian writers commit a radical abstraction when they create their images of perfection, but this is the price paid by all general sociology, including that which is wholly neutral and descriptive. The last use of utopianism is moral. Utopian literature (including the literature relevant or allied to it) is a repository of reflection on human nature. Although not directly concerned to expose frailty, to scrutinize motives, and to astonish with cynical revelations, utopian literature has in it much hard psychological intelligence. Utopian writers disagree among themselves on the extent to which human nature is reformable, but rarely is this problem treated lightly. Indeed, it is usually acknowledged as the problem requiring the deepest study; it is also the source of the greatest hesitation. The principal mission of utopianism is to encourage the hope that human nature is changeable for the better beyond the limits assigned by worldly pessimism or theological despair. That the real world, despite its amazing pluralist variety, still does not exhaust the possibilities of human nature is the heart of utopianism. The long series of utopian texts enlarge the world by suggesting new character types and new social milieus in which these types could emerge. They also enlarge the world by their claim that the societies of the world ignore, repress, distort, or destroy human potentialities that have not yet been fulfilled. It is true that the concept of harmony rules out some segment of the spectrum of human nature. The essence of antiutopianism is the charge that any imaginable utopia, like any generous philosophical anthropology, actually impoverishes human nature by not allowing scope to those traits — wildness, excess, discontent, perversity, risk-taking, heroism — that threaten harmony. If therefore the precondition of a harmonious life is the thorough manageability of people, allegedly for their own good, human nature must suffer a terrible diminution. Such diminution is the awful hidden human sacrifice that utopianism exacts with a good conscience. What intensity of experience, what craving for more than satisfaction, what passion for the unknown and the unlimited, would be left? Humanity should always face difficulties that are impossible or nearly impossible to overcome. For many people, perhaps most, utopia can and does already appear in experiences and temporary conditions, in moments and episodes, in the world as it is. Each person\\'s utopia is different from everyone else\\'s. Utopia cannot be an uninterrupted and common way of life for a whole society. The only genuine utopia is actual life, and every proposed utopia is a dystopia. The critique of utopianism is without doubt a rich field and numbers Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among its luminaries. A shrewd and witty antiutopian satire is Aldous Huxley\\'s novel Brave New World (1932). A related antiutopian theme is that utopias are often driven by a strong passion for equality that threatens to efface all that is fine or rare in life or that can be created by or appeal to only a few. Utopias level society and thus work to make people more or less uniform and interchangeable; preaching individual expressive growth, utopias often destroy the social and psychological conditions of such growth. Utopian harmony is only monotonous. In rebuttal, utopian writers and their sympathizers are proud to confine their imagination to the realm of the largest happiness. Within that realm, utopians say, much more human excellence is possible than many people commonly think. That would be proven, if only the world, or a part of it, could be transformed or would become more permissive. Without subscribing to any set of specific utopian ideas, one can appreciate — at least to a moderate extent — the efforts of utopian writers to rescue this sentiment from the disparagement of those who believe, explicitly or not, that pain not only will but should remain, if not definitive of the human condition, then its substratum.

This perception is wrong. The word utopia was used in the title to a book written by Sir Thomas More which described an island nation and satirized the Catholic Church, Protestant theology, and lawyers (The full title of the book translated from Latin is A Truly Golden Little Book, No Less Beneficial Than Entertaining, of a Republic’s Best State, and of the New Island Utopia ). The word was formed from Greek and literally translated means no place. In modern usage the word utopia is generally considered to be a place which is better than any found in contemporary society and which is thus non-existent. Many efforts have been made in the past to create utopian communities, isolated from the contemporary society they were created to escape. Some have been created for the purpose of unfettered worship, others for the purpose of living in complete harmony with nature, still others to experience a completely egalitarian society. Many so-called hippie communes attempted to achieve a utopian society in the 1960s, nearly all of them were short lived. Besides the works of Plato and Sir Thomas More there is a long list of utopian society in literature, including Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels , Men Like Gods by H. G. Wells, and Andromeda , by Ivan Yefremov. The oldest known manuscript page of Plato’s Republic, where the first description of a perfect society is recorded. Wikipedia Here are the brief histories of ten utopian communities in the United States. Brook Farm, now a park, in Massachusetts. Wikimedia Brook Farm, Massachusetts The philosophy of transcendentalism began to develop in New England in the late 1820s, as an argument against the rise of both spiritualism and intellectualism. Its supporters believed that human beings are inherently good, and the trappings of society corrupted them. Transcendentalists believed that humans find their true selves through intuitive means, and reach their best when they are completely self-reliant. George Ripley, a Unitarian minister, and his wife Sophia embraced the philosophy and in 1841 established Brook Farm as a joint stock company about ten miles outside Boston in West Roxbury. In essence, the joint stock arrangement meant that participants in the community would share in the work as well as the profits generated by the farm. Each member would choose whatever work they wished, including women, and each member would be paid equally. Visitors to the farm paid a fee, which was added to the community funds from which everyone was paid. A school system established on the farm created income through outsiders’ attendance, but the farm itself was not profitable. By 1844 the members were operating under the socialism promoted by Charles Fourier and published a newspaper called The Harbinger promoting what they Fourierism . The members began the construction of an enormous community building called the Phalanstery, which would house all indoor activities for the community. It was destroyed by fire. Following the expense of building the Phalanstery and its destruction (it was uninsured) the community collapsed financially. It gradually shut down and was completely closed by 1847. One of the community’s founders was novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, who invested in the community despite not being a strict follower of their beliefs. Hawthorne used the experience as the basis for the novel The Blithedale Romance. The remaining buildings and property were taken over by the Lutheran Church, which used the property as an orphanage and school for well over a century. Many of the original buildings were eventually destroyed by fire. The farm is today operated as a historic site by Massachusetts.'}, {'title': 'Examples of Utopia: Types and Features of Ideal Societies', 'url': 'https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/examples-utopia-types-features', 'content': 'Have you ever pictured the perfect world through the words of your favorite novel? Then you\\'ve thought about a utopia. This word actually came from literature when Sir Thomas More used the word utopia to describe the perfect island. Get a clear idea of what a utopia is and see several utopia examples. When you think of the perfect world, you might think of heaven or a world with no wars. Several writers and philosophers have tried to imagine the perfect world. But by definition, the term utopia refers to an ideal or place in which all aspects are perfect or nearly so. So, where did utopia come from? Sir Thomas More created the concept name in 1516 as the title of his book, Utopia . Within his book, More created a fictional description of an island that had the qualities of perfection. Since then, many writers and philosophers have tried to create a utopian society. However, most fictional utopias actually turn out to be a dystopia, an imaginary world with suffering and injustice. A prime example of a utopia that\\'s actually a dystopia is seen in George Orwell\\'s 19 84 . You can also view a dystopia in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World . Examples of utopia, in various contexts, as represented through literature, art, popular culture, and other means include: The Garden of Eden, an aesthetically pleasing place in which there was \"no knowledge of good and evil\" Heaven, a religious supernatural place where God, angels and human souls live in harmony Shangri-La, in James Hilton\\'s Lost Horizon, a mystical harmonious valley Tao Yuanming\\'s The Peach Blossom Spring, which describes a beautiful secluded community not affected by the rest of the world Ellis\\'s description in Specimens of Early English Poets of the Land of Cockaigne , a place where \"houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry\" The entire Golden A ge as described by Hesiod, a Greek poet The Federation in the Star Trek series The Capital in The Hunger Games series, a place of luxury and freedoms England in Aldous Huxley\\'s Brave New World , a place with no wars or hunger but also no emotion The term utopia was originally a description of a social environment and has manifested in many ways. The idea of \"world peace\" is considered utopian in nature, and United States communes were attempts at utopian ways of living. However, there are several different features of an ideal society. In an ecological utopia, the society would work in harmony with the nature around them. Rather than producing waste and pollution, people would become one with nature to have ecological harmony. Utopian idealism took off after the 18th century. Those seeking economic utopia are partially responsible for the development of commercialism and capitalism, although they were combined with some socialist characteristics in the early 19th century. Much of the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was working toward a self-sustaining utopian economy. Religious utopias exist in concept, both as intra-religious ideals as well as inter-religious. In these types of societies, faith controls every aspect of a person\\'s life, creating religious harmony. For example, the Amish community works towards religious utopia. Scientific utopias pertain to the idea of perfection in terms of living standards. Means of attempting to achieve utopia through science include ideas that omit death and suffering from life or make the human condition perfect. Scientific and technological utopias are oftentimes connected. Technological utopian lifestyles would be those that replace human needs or functions with technology in such a way that humans have a higher quality of life. An example of a technology utopia is Francis Bacon\\'s New Atlantis . You have seen many different examples of utopia, so it\\'s easy to imagine your own utopia by thinking of your idea of the perfect society or the perfect world. Now that you’ve had a taste of utopia, check out examples of dystopia .'}, {'title': '26b. Experiments with Utopia - US History', 'url': 'https://www.ushistory.org/us/26b.asp', 'content': '26b. Experiments with Utopia The town of Amana, Iowa operated as a communal society for 89 years. Most of the settlers were immigrants who had left Germany in 1842 and came to Iowa in 1855. As 19th century America grew larger, richer, and more diverse, it was also trying to achieve a culture that was distinct and not imitative of any in Europe. At the same time, the thirst for individual improvement had local communities creating debating clubs, library societies, and literary associations for the purpose of sharing interesting and provocative ideas. Maybe, people speculated, if any society were completely reorganized, it could be regenerated and, ultimately, perfected. Utopia , originally a Greek word for an imaginary place where everyone and everything is perfect, was sought in America through the creation of model communities within the greater society. The Shakers believed in celibacy in and outside of wedlock, therefore Shaker children were usually orphans given to the church. Most of the original utopias were created for religious purposes. One of the earliest was devised by George Rapp , a German zealot, who took 600 followers to western Pennsylvania in 1804. Using shared funds to purchase land, the Rappites created a commune where they isolated themselves from others while waiting for the Revelation. Because of their extreme views on sex and marriage, and their strict, literal interpretation of the Bible, they failed to spread goodwill or gain converts. More hospitable to their neighbors and able to attract about 6,000 members by the 1830s, twenty successful Shaker communities flourished. They followed the principles of simplicity, celibacy, common property, equal labor and reward espoused by their founder Mother Ann Lee . Courtesy of the Longman History Place Religious and Utopian communities dotted the countryside during the 1800s. The founders of Brook Farm tried to create a society of equality for its members. Gradually, utopian communities came to reflect social perfectibility rather than religious purity. Robert Owen , for example, believed in economic and political equality. Those principles, plus the absence of a particular religious creed, were the 1825 founding principles of his New Harmony, Indiana , cooperative that lasted for only two years before economic failure. Charles Fourier , a French reformer and philosopher, set out the goal of social harmony through voluntary \"phalanxes\" that would be free of government interference and ultimately arise, unite and become a universal perfect society. John Humphrey Noyes designed Oneida community in upstate New York. Oneidans experimented with group marriage, communal child rearing, group discipline, and attempts to improve the genetic composition of their offspring. Self-reliance, optimism, individualism and a disregard for external authority and tradition characterized one of the most famous of all the American communal experiments. Brook Farm , near Roxbury, Massachusetts, was founded to promote human culture and brotherly cooperation. It was supposed to bestow the highest benefits of intellectual, physical, and moral education to all its members. Through hard work and simplicity, those who joined the fellowship of George Ripley\\'s farm were supposed to understand and live in social harmony, free of government, free to perfect themselves. However, Nathaniel Hawthorne , who wrote about his stay here in The Blithedale Romance , left this utopia disillusioned. Finally, it was romantic thinker and strict vegetarian Bronson Alcott , father of author Louisa May Alcott , who devoted himself to tilling the soil at Fruitlands from June 1844 to January 1845 in the hope that love, education, and mutual labor would bring him and his small following peace. He was later ridiculed as \"a man bent on saving the world by a return to acorns.\" The 1840s marked the height of the utopian trials. The belief that man was \"naturally\" good and that human institutions were perfectible had raised tremendous expectations about the possibilities of reform and renewal. These experiments ultimately disintegrated but, for a while, tried to be ideal places where a brotherhood of followers shared equally in the goods of their labor and lived in peace. It seemed that within the great American experiment, searching for utopia required only the commitment of people who found it easy to believe that nothing was impossible.'}]"

Utopian dreams and dystopian worries are powerful tools for thinking about what sorts of changes a society should pursue or avoid, and what underlying dynamics these proposed changes expose. This series examines the tradition of utopian and dystopian thought in western culture, beginning with the ancient Greeks, but continuing on into the modern period. Our focus in this series will be on the important social, political, and economic ideas and issues raised in different utopian stories. When we look into utopian stories, and their historical times, what we\\'ll see reflected in the stories of utopia are the social, political, and economic concerns of the authors, their societies, and or their particular social class. The meaning of the word \\'utopia\\' comes to us from ancient Greece. In our modern world the word takes its current form because of Thomas More\\'s 1516 book of the same name. Indeed, it is this book from which most of the modern western European utopian tradition takes its origin; or at least, this work inaugurates its most common trope. Where we have in our lexicon one \\'utopia\\', the Greeks had two. The difference, even confusion, between them marks an essential cleavage. For the Greeks, there was both Eu- topia, and Ou-topia. Both are derived in part from the Greek word topos , which means \"place\", and the suffix \\' ia \\' meaning land. Translated into English, \\'Ou-topia\\' means something like, \" No-place land\", whereas \\'Eu-topia\\' translates as \"good-place land\". More succinctly, the difference is between the idea of the best place, and an impossible place. It is the difference between a place which does not exist, because it has not yet been realized, and a place which cannot, and could not, ever exist. Our modern word is pronounced as the Greeks pronounced \\'Eutopia\\'. However, the meanings of these Greek words were confused by modern writers, who ended up with the spelling \\'utopia\\', from the old English \\'Utopie\\' as opposed to \"Eutopia\", as meaning \"good place\". This basic confusion about utopias, between \"good place\" and \"no place\", inserts an important ambiguity directly in the center of thinking about utopias. This ambiguity forces one to wonder of utopian writers, Are their visions supposed to be dreams of possible futures meant to incite us to action, or are they impossible dreams meant as reminders that the world is not easily re-shaped by human effort? Is a utopia supposed to be a good place or a no-place? Is the author supporting or condemning the practices of the fictional societies they describe? One qualification must be made right away. A utopia is not a paradise. There is a colloquial usage of \\'utopia\\' and \\'utopian\\' that seem to suggest that it is a paradise. And compared to the societies in which actual humans lives, many of the fictional utopias would have indeed been seen as paradises, relatively speaking. However, we must draw a technical distinction between a paradise or a golden-age, and a utopia. In a paradise or golden-age no work and no effort are required by humans to obtain the things they want and need. Perhaps the most famous golden-age many are familiar with would be the Biblical Garden of Eden. Another well-known paradise is described in the mid-14th century poem The Land of Cockaigne , where fully cooked turkey legs literally fly through the air and into one\\'s mouth. In this place the only effort one need put in is to chew. The whole idea of a Cockaigne, or a paradise, is that everything one would ever need is abundantly supplied without any effort. The natural world is just so constructed - either at random or by design - that there springs forth automatically an abundance of everything necessary for everyone, all the time, always. In this kind of society, or world, there never arises anything resembling what we - or most societies in the history of our world - call a political problem. Everyone has enough of everything. So there is no cause for argument. There is no inequality, because everyone has everything everyone else has. Or at least, everyone has access to just as much of what others have whenever they would like it. In this kind of world what causes could there be for strife, or for civil war? A paradise, or a golden-age, is thus totally non-political, and not terribly interesting. What this means is that utopias are enough like our own condition, our own world, that we can take inspiration from them. They are enough like the social conditions we know that we can learn lessons for and about ourselves and our societies by examining at them. This is exactly what makes utopias so interesting. As we will see, utopian literature has a long, very long, history with human beings. The enduring appeal of and, interest in utopias testifies to their relevance. This is the reason that we too are looking at utopias. We are all concerned with, or at least we are all effected by, the way our society is organized. By looking at how other ideal societies might be organized we can explore the merits, and demerits of various kinds of social institutions, and of the various ways of structuring those institutions. We are concerned to change our own society, and utopias allow us to think about the direction of that change. We have a colloquial usage of the word \\'utopia\\' and \\'utopian\\' in contemporary society that works to prohibit much creative thought, and dismisses utopian thought as feckless, and as such, worthless. Part of the aims of this series is to demonstrate the value of this \"worthless\" endeavor. Dreaming, far from idle, far from impotent, is essential. Without wonder, without questions, the human imagination will atrophy. The value of utopia is that thinking about utopias allows us to both critique present societies, and also to articulate a vision of how we\\'d like our societies to be different. The deeper value of utopian thinking is that it sets us free, free to speculate and more importantly to give expression to our striving, to our desire for a better world. Everything human beings can be must first be dreamed by human beings. This is the value of utopia and dystopia. Thus, the first pre-requisite for this series is the rejection of this colloquial notion of utopia and the utopian. Dismissed from the start, it will not be a surprise if we fail to learn anything from our utopian traditions. Introduction Brief, but spectacular. That is how I think of the Occupy movement. An article I read recently lamented that the anniversaries of this movement seem to come and go now with but a murmur, a faint echo of the voice that all too briefly seemed capable of shaking American society out of complacency, of opening up new possibilities. There have by now been enough autopsies of this movement, and its failures, that there is no need for another. One thing that stands out is of course the fact that the movement never coalesced around a set of demands, never formulated a coherent political programme. Whether or not the Occupy movement did a good job distilling its critique, and its vision, neither were sufficiently theoretically developed or promulgated. Occupy in many senses seem to try to be a leaderless and theory-less movement. Of course, the main reason for the end of the Occupy movement was the physical clearance of the encampments by the thugs of the ruling class, that is, the police. Much more fruitfully, when we look to the practice of Occupy, and the many encampments around the country, and indeed around the world, we can see that there is certainly a clear political, and moral ethos animating the activity and structure of the movement. What emerged from the Occupy encampments was an ethos of self-organization, free association, of de-centralized participatory democracy, and non-market modes of distribution. In Occupy encampments around the country people organized themselves to provide many kinds of basic, and some more advanced, services and community infrastructure, e.g. free meals, free educational opportunities, free healthcare, and much more. The diversity of services offered by different Occupy encampments was truly an amazing display of cooperation, solidarity, and self-organization. And indeed, this is what was really threatening about the occupy movement, it offered a robust vision of a more participatory, more solidaristic form of community, and worked diligently to create this, first within the bounds of its camps, and then the communities around the camps. Building up a vision of a new society, and a physical representation of that vision, became a major challenge to the ruling class because of the speed with which this movement grew and gathered strength. Occupy was not the first time \"utopian\" ideas of more democratic, more participatory, more egalitarian, forms of community captured the imagination of Americans, and threatened the ruling class by becoming a movement. This has happened several times in our history, but, as one might expect, these lie outside the mainstream narrative of U.S. history. Thankfully, in the wake of Howard Zinn, much work has been done to recover and disseminate the knowledge and memory of the existence of radicals and revolutionaries, not to mention their important role, in American history. Utopian ideas, and vision of better societies have captured the imagination of Americans, and become large movements more than once. These largely forgotten episodes include the Bellamyite movement in the 1890s, and the Fourierist movement of the 1840s. These latter two represent the more secular and political end of the spectrum of utopian experiments in American history. Looking Backwards, on Bellamyism While it is almost totally forgotten now, at the end of the 19th century, the only American works of fiction to sell more copies than Edward Bellamy\\'s Looking Backwards were Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin , and Ben-Hur . His book, and the ideas and vision contained in it, was so wildly popular that is spawned an intense, but short-lived political movement in the form of Bellamyite \"Nationalist Clubs\"; indeed they were often called \"Bellamy Clubs\". These clubs arose quickly following the release of Bellamy\\'s novel, and while the first club originated in Boston, chapters soon popped up in cities across the nation. These clubs, via coordinated activity, became a political force as a movement in the first half of the last decade of the nineteenth century, before disappearing after merging with the Populist movement. They turned Bellamy himself into a politician, although he was perhaps not well suited to the role of leader of a socialist political movement. When Looking Backward was published in 1888 its popularity owed much to its readability, engaging narrative, but especially to its grand vision of a utopian future. Another big part of its popularity was conditioned by the times in which its author lived. Over the course of Edward Bellamy\\'s forty-eight years he saw a great deal of turmoil, indeed, he would have been around fifteen the year the Civil war ended, and not quite twenty five when the Long Depression began in 1873. After the war American society experienced the rise of giant integrated capitalist firms - the infamous trusts - to positions of monopoly power; it had experienced a series of sometimes devastating economic recessions and depressions; it was experiencing increasing labor militance and strikes, for example the Great Strike of 1887; in conjunction with the latter, there was much radical socialist political agitation, see for example the 1886 Haymarket Affair and its highly controversial aftermath. Over this time the social effects of capitalism and industrialization became more pronounced. As is the still the case, it was workers, and the poor who bore the costs of material \"progress\". From the end of the Civil war to the turn of the century was when American capitalism really came into its own, when it rose to social and political dominance. As material prosperity of society increased, it looked to increasingly many Americans that, economically and politically, the decked was stacked against them, and that the lion\\'s share of these gains were being accumulated by the wealthy. Bellamy adopts the Rip Van Winkle trope and has his protagonist fall asleep in then present-day 1887, and wake up over a century later in the year 2000. Bellamy\\'s hero, Julian West, finds himself in a utopian future society in which the evils of the world of 1887 have been rectified through application of reason, science, and technology. The book takes the form of a kind of guided tour of the future given to Julian by his host, a Dr. Leete, who is caring for Julian after he wakes up. Dr. Leete and his family take turns escorting Julian around, showing him different aspects of the future, and answering his many questions about how the world of the future works, and how things came to be that way. Long story short, the Unites States of the future has been transformed by a rational and irresistible bloodless revolution into a socialist utopia, as one giant national trust, operated for the public benefit. All industries have been nationalized, and are democratically controlled by their workers; there is centralized distribution of important goods; there is gender equality; the economy has been reorganized as a rational and egalitarian \"Industrial Army\". As Bellamy describes this future, there are no wars, no government, no bankers, no corruption, no jails, and no more \"buying\" and \"selling\". The social revolution that brings about the society of the future, as Bellamy presents it, occurs much like Marx describes. The revolution is a natural occurrence, and as such irresistible, that happened once society developed to a certain level of rationality. Once people become sufficiently rational they simply perceive the need to radically transform society, and then do so in the form of a revolutionary mass social movement that peacefully takes power and then restructures society. Bellamy, like many of his age, was not keen to abandon the benefits of industrialization, and mass production, but wanted to change the composition and distribution of what is produced. Thus, his vision of the future economy is one where society takes the form of one large trust, but because it will be run democratically by worker-citizens, it will pursue their interests. Bellamy\\'s vision is a kind of syndicalism, in which a congress of industrial unions forms the core of the national government. Moreover, because the people of the future are so rational they organize their society along the most rational, and thus egalitarian, lines. This is why, for example, in Bellamy\\'s utopia social classes are not abolished but re-organized on rational lines, which for him means according to age. This there is a course of age-based classes, or stages, all persons pass through. All the stages are designed to maximize the development of citizens\\' personal talents and capacities, to effectively train people to be competent workers fit for important jobs, as well as to be active and engaged citizens. The application of reason to social problems results, in Bellamy\\'s utopia, in progressive policies like equal educational and occupational opportunities for women; everyone must work between 21 and 45; universal basic education for all until 21; occupations decided, as much as possible, by aptitude; remuneration based on effort; college open to all, with admissions based on social need and individual merit; free universal healthcare. In keeping with his syndicalist vision, Bellamy\\'s utopia has a political structure framed around industrial unions. Bellamy\\'s novel envisions the future President of the United States as the general of the Industrial Army, and serving a five year term. This person is to be elected by a vote of all those worker-citizens who have retired, i.e. those over forty five years of age. In this utopia there would be ten industrial departments, or unions, each with its own head, or chief, elected by the retied members of the individual departments; the group of these chiefs serves as a kind of cabinet to the President. There is a national congress, which meets every five years to pass or revise laws. He proposes a separate entity he calls, the Inspectorate, to pursue consumer complaints, fraud, abuse, misconduct, et cetera . The job this agency is to seek out graft, inefficiency, or waste, as well as health, safety, or environmental hazards. The central metaphor of Bellamy\\'s novel is presented in his analogy of the General and the Balloon. Dr. Leete in trying to explain the reasoning behind the organization of the society and economy of the future tells Julian, \"It is easier for a general up in a balloon with perfect survey of the field, to manoeuvre a million men to victory then for a sergeant to mange a platoon in a thicket\". [1] It is most rational to organize society into one big corporation because this will facilitate macro-level social and economic planning in the public interest. The idea is to harness the power of the large trusts, because their centralization afforded them a larger view of the economic landscape, and allows them to plan accordingly. Under capitalism this planning took the form of the great trusts trying to manage competition between oligopolists to keep prices and profits high. When all the nation\\'s industries were organized under centralized control, like in a trust, and all these trusts nationalized, society would be able to engage in the kind of economic planning that can create the utopian society Julian West encounters. The idea for the Bellamy clubs emerged very soon after the novel debuted. A reporter in Boston, Cyrus Field Willard, is credited with coming up with idea, as there is a surviving letter in which he ask Bellamy for permission to found a club to promote Bellamy\\'s ideas. Bellamy assented, and the ball began rolling. In the fall of 1888 Willard\\'s \"Nationalist Circle\", merged with the independently organized \"Boston Bellamy Club\" of Charles E. Bower & Arthur F. Deveraux to found the first permanent Bellamyite group. The Bellamyite movement was at this point more a moral association than a political party. In 1889 they began publishing a magazine, The Nationalist . Groups were very quickly founded in large Eastern cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington D.C.. The movement was particularly strong in California. That state had sixty five local clubs, whereas, even a large and populous state like New York had only sixteen local Bellamyite groups. The early Bellamyite movement eschewed political action, that is, participation in a \\'democratic\\' political process they felt was rigged. They focused instead on propaganda, e.g. organizing public lectures, printing and distributing pamphlets and periodicals. As the fever pitch of labor and socialist militance and agitation, combined with events like the Great Strike of 1887 and the Homestead Strike of 1892, the Bellamyite movement reversed course and engaged furiously in political activity focused on more immediate gains, with a particular emphasis on the elections of 1892. The economic and political climate of the age created other reform minded groups in addition to Bellamyites, groups which would cooperate and compete with each other as they often had large segments of over-lapping memberships. Economic depression, political corruption, financial speculation and market manipulation, all fueled the rise of the Populist movement, and of the People\\'s Party. Bellamy, and many other members of the Nationalist clubs were so supportive of the People\\'s Party that eventually the Bellamyite movement merged into the Populist movement. The failure of Bellamy as a political candidate did not help the situation, as the alliance of the People\\'s Party and the Bellamyites rendered most of the latter\\'s organizational functions redundant. In the wake of the 1892 elections the Bellamyite movement began to dissipate as it was largely subsumed by the Populist movement. In early 1894 Bellamy\\'s own journal, The New Nation , was forced to close due to financial difficulties. Later in this same year Bellamy ceased his political activity on behalf of the movement that bore his name. Other Bellamyite periodicals continued to be published over the next couple years, but in dwindling numbers. By 1896 there were only a handful of Bellamyite groups still active, for example those in Wisconsin which were organized enough to run candidates for state offices that year. After this, the Bellamyite movement basically vanishes as a movement, save for a scattering of die-hards. Bellamy himself would die only two years later, on May 22nd 1898. Though he claimed that he did not write his novel with the aim of providing an explicit plan of economic and political reform, his utopian vision of a more democratic, more equal future resonated deeply with a nation weary of the effects of capitalism. Political Utopias in Antebellum America The populist and reform movements of the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the socialist movement emerging in this era, had important precursors in American history. Indeed, the success of a radical utopian inspired movement like Bellamyism will not surprise one acquainted with the utopian movements of antebellum America. There was a very limited Owenite movement in America during the 1820s, the culmination of which was the experimental community at New Harmony, Indiana. Much more extensive and successful was the Fourierist movement that emerged in the 1840s. [2] This movement attracted a fairly large following, and was able to establish a number of experimental communities, called Phalanxes. In contrast to Bellamyism, which was an American movement, both Owenism and Fourierism are European movements which crossed the Atlantic. The success of Fourierism, and relative lack of success of Owenism, in transplanting to America is explained in part by the differences in the economic climates in which they came to America. Fourierism resonated more deeply with Americans than Owenism mostly because they were more open to radical utopian experiments in the wake of the economic crisis of 1837, and the depression that followed. If not for the economic crisis of 1873 and the ensuing depression, the 1886 Haymarket Affair, the Great Strike 1887, the crash of 1893 and the depression that followed, Bellamyism may not have emerged as a mass movement. One major difference between Owenism and Fourierism, and a factor in their respective levels of success, is in the manner of their transplantation to America. While Owenism was brought to America by Owen and his sons, Fourierism was brought back to America by an American disciple of Fourier\\'s, Albert Brisbane. Owen purchased the town of New Harmony in Indiana from its previous occupants with the intention of founding a utopian community there based on his philosophic principles and the lessons learned in operating his mills at New Lanark in Scotland. American Fourierists began with editing Fourier\\'s ideas into a coherent form, and then propagandizing on behalf of these ideas. When these agitation efforts combined with economic depression in the wake of 1837, with the lingering effects of the second Great Awakening, the example of successful utopian communities in America, and the sympathetic affinities of various immigrant groups Fourierism became a rather large movement. At its high point the Fourierist movement could boast of dozens of Phalanxes across America. Owenism The Owenite movement in America was comprised almost entirely of the experimental utopian community the movements\\' founder Robert Owen established, and his efforts to acquire funding and attract personnel for this community. Though there were other Owenite communities in the U.S., the story of Owenism in America is largely the story of the New Harmony colony. Unfortunately, Owen found little success in America, less than some of the experiments within Great Britain, and his utopian experiment lasted only four years before the colonists abandoned the Owenite philosophy. The community at New Harmony persisted, but they were no longer an Owenite utopian project. Owen had originally purchased the land, and a few buildings, from the previous residents at New Harmony. These previous occupants were Rappites colonists, a mostly German Protestant religious sect, which had moved to Indiana from Pennsylvania to more freely practice their beliefs and communal way of life. After establishing the first group of settlers at his community, Owen left his son William in charge at New Harmony and returned east to find more funds and colonists for his project. When Owen returned in April of 1825 he found the community of several hundred residents in chaos. He did his best to put matters in order, and succeeded fairly well, he departed again in June 1825 in search of more funds and colonists. In all, Owen spent only a few months residing at New Harmony. Within two years of its founding as an Owenite utopian experiment the New Harmony community was an economic failure, that is, it was not financially or materially self-supporting. There are a host of reasons that account for the failure of the Owenite experiment at New Harmony. The colony had trouble attracting residents, and those who did come were not always of the highest caliber. While New Harmony did bring in many ideologically committed Owenites, it also welcomed in many types of people. In a letter, Robert Dale Owen, one of Robert\\'s sons, describes the population of New Harmony as, \"a heterogeneous collection of radicals, enthusiastic devotees to principle, honest latitudinarians, and lazy theorists, with a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in\". [3] In another letter, William Owen, another of Robert\\'s sons, says that besides committed Owenites, New Harmony had attracted, \"crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town makes success unlikely\". [4] There was a laundry list of complaints about why the New Harmony project failed; not enough skilled craftsmen; not enough unskilled laborers; insufficient and inexperienced management and supervision; not enough housing; not enough land; not enough privacy; too much freedom; not enough freedom. Robert Owen was often away from the colony and, like him, many colonists only stayed a few months. This high turnover, as well as the problems listed above, seemed to doom this project from the outset. Between the motley collection of colonists, the factional infighting, and the lack of economic viability, the New Harmony settlement ended as a failure for Owen. The lack of economic success and factional squabbles over questions of theoretical principles and practical organization led to a large schism at New Harmony in 1826. A group carried on the Owenite project for another couple years, but finally gave up the ghost in 1829. In 1827, Owen severed ties with the community he founded, transferring ownership to his sons. After 1829 the town abandoned Owenism, and converted their community to a traditional capitalist private property system. While the town was a failure as a utopian experiment, it did produce some very interesting and significant results and persons. Under Owenite leadership New Harmony could boast of the first free public library, and the first free public school. It also became a leading center of scientific discovery in the natural science, in particular in geology where Owen\\'s third son David Dale achieved prominence. Robert Dale, the oldest son of Robert Owen, in addition to publishing many books and pamphlets, served in both the Indiana state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. He advocated for women\\'s rights, for free public education, and opposed slavery. It was in fact Robert Dale Owen who introduced the bill which founded the now world famous Smithsonian Institution. Fourierism Like the Owenites, the practical activity of the Fourierist movement in America was directed towards the founding of utopian communities. In the minds of the Fourierists these communities, or rather the network of these communities, would form the basis of the new society, and the transformative effects would radiate out from these communities. Though the Fourierists did much to expound and promulgate their theories in writing, their main energy was directed at founding and linking Fourierist phalanxes. A working example of their vision of a utopian way of life would, in their estimation, be the best piece of propaganda they could have. An operational model Phalanx was more likely to attract actual converts than hundreds of pounds of printed literature. One quite decisive advantage of the Fourierists was that they, unlike Owen, were not intensely skeptical. Indeed, the embrace of religious arguments, appeals to religious morality, and the use of religious modes of presenting Fourierist ideas very much helped Fourierism gain a large following in America. The Fourierist movement was more successful than the Owenite movement in America, and thus it was larger and more diverse. It was however, more distant in its ideology and practice from its founder than the Owenite movement was from Owen. The experience of the movement is not so directly tied to any one individual community. This movement was, like Owenism, short-lived, despite many Fourierists being intensely passionate. Albert Brisbane, an American traveling in Europe, became a votary of Charles Fourier and his utopian socialist philosophy. In the early 1830s Brisbane returned to America and eagerly set to work proselytizing for Fourier\\'s ideas; edited and parsed by Brisbane for American audiences. By 1840 he was publishing The Phalanx , a Fourierist journal, but his big break came in 1842 when Horace Greeley allowed Brisbane to purchase a front-page column in his popular newspaper The New York Tribune . This platform allowed Brisbane to bring Fourier\\'s ideas to the huge audience of the Tribune \\'s readership. Running for about a year and a half, and reprinted in dozens of other newspapers, Brisbane\\'s column, helped ignite the spark of the American Fourierist movement. We should note that Brisbane was not alone in working to advance Fourier\\'s ideas in America, nor was his journal the only Fourierist publication, though it was among the earliest. Over the next decade, Fourierist phalanxes sprung up across the country, perhaps the most famous of which was the Brook Farm community in Massachusetts. The organized Fourierist movement established at least thirty phalanxes, and at it height, the movement consisted of perhaps as many as fifty Fourierist communities. One must be cognizant that there were several strains of Fourierism in America, and so deciding which communities count as Fourierist can sometimes be a matter of debate. The \"phalanx\" was the name Fourier gave to his ideal utopian communities. They were largely agricultural, but did not reject machinery. They were designed to self-sustaining communities in which all participants would have a chance to prosper. Fourier\\'s phalanxes were not communist, since they were supposed to contain inequalities, that is, individuals were to be rewarded both for their effort as well as their contribution of capital. By the mid-1850s however, all but a hardy few phalanxes remained. What few did survive the collapse of the movement, were wiped out by the Civil war. Most Fourierist phalanxes lasted, on average, only a couple years; indeed, critics labeled Fourierists, \\'four-year-ites\\'. The longest lasting community was the North American Phalanx of Colts Neck, New Jersey, which was in continuous operation for twelve years. There is one very important way that the experience of the Brook Farm community was characteristic of the larger Fourierist movement. The Brook Farm community was originally established as a utopian community by Transcendentalist-inspired reformers. In the spring of 1841 George Ripley, and a small coterie of fellows, decamped to Brook Farm and established an experimental utopian community. Their aims were to counter the effects of a depersonalized and unequal society by removing themselves from that society, and forming a more ideal communal way of life. The Brook Farmers rejected Emerson\\'s more individualistic, more isolationist, vision of Transcendentalist \"self-culture\". After four years of disorganization, factional quibbles, and lack of a cohesive vision, inhibiting the communities\\' prosperity, the Brook Farmers decided to adopt Fourierism in1844 because it offered a more concrete plan and structure. This is what attracted many, beyond Transcendentalists, to Fourier\\'s system, and to Fourierist phalanxes, in this era. It was a detailed plan of action for forming communities in an age when so many utopian schemes were vague and ill-defined. The Fourierist movement, brief as its life may have been, as well as the legacy of its example, made important contributions to later American political movements. Several important legacies of the Fourierist movement stand out. First, in the 1840s the Fourierists were among the earliest and strongest critics of the nascent industrial capitalist order. The Fourierists criticized capitalism as an anti-democratic system of \"industrial feudalism\" which subordinated workers to employers. Fourierism, and indeed the whole communitarian movement, achieved its prominence at a kind of tipping point in American history, and its failure to stop the advance of the burgeoning industrial capitalism set American society on different path than had this movement had more success. On a longer view, the legacy of the Fourierist movement continued to be seen in the communitarian aspects of the American socialist movement, as well as in the American labor movement, especially in its advocacy of producers\\' and consumers\\' cooperatives. The Fourierist movement has an additional interesting legacy in the way that it influenced the thinking of Edward Bellamy. Indeed, several important elements of Fourierist philosophy appear in Bellamy\\'s utopia. Conclusion The utopian alternative was very much alive in 19th-century America. The threat various utopian movements constituted can be seen in the sheer numbers of people who flocked to religious or secular utopian communities all over the country. From the 1820s through the 1850s thousands and thousands of Americans experimented with utopianism, joining one or another experimental community. Over these decades nearly one hundred different utopian communities and projects were launched in America. Some lasted just a few months, others only a few years. Others, however, enjoyed some longevity. In general, the utopian communities that tended to last longer were the religiously inspired ones, which also very often had the advantage of being ethno-religious groupings. Many utopian groups like the Rappites or Harmonists, the Amish, and the Hutterites, were largely German Protestant sects. Though there were religious groups, e.g. the Shakers, who were successful at converting many different kinds of people to their way of life. Other utopian groups attempted to create new religions, e.g. the Mormons, and the Oneida community. In a fairly common pattern, people turned to utopian communities when economic hardship became most acute, and then left when conditions improved. The very existence of alternative, non-for-profit, ways of living posed a threat to the nascent capitalist order in America. It was only in the decades after the Civil war that most kinds of utopian communities became economically unviable as corporate consolidation, mechanization of production, and economies of scale replaced durable hand-made goods with cheaper but less durable factory-made goods. Utopian communities, as small-scale industrial producers of craft goods could simply not compete. Though many of these communities continued to be self-sufficient and survived as communities, their prosperity at first slowly, and then rather quickly, diminished, making attracting new followers and maintaining their communities difficult. What the experience of utopian communities, both religious and secular, testifies to is the ability of possibility to capture the imagination, and to inspire action. Their many different aims and principles notwithstanding, these utopian movements all sought to transform the lives of human beings through radically transforming social relations. Beyond utopian experiments in communal living, utopian thinking provided some inspiration for more practical movements like the early women\\'s suffrage movement, the abolitionist movement, and the prohibitionist movement. The Occupy movement, brief but spectacular, is part of this utopian tradition in American history. Its memory is worth preserving, its anniversaries worth noting, because of the utopian aspect of its existence. Even for a brief time, just as with our 19th century forebears, a utopian political movement allowed a great many people the freedom to participate in the dream that a better world is possible, to experience the thrill of feeling that such a possible better world could be realized.

Alas, afraid of how the world is evolving; eager to keep for ourselves what we have; willing to preserve the certainties that we have built in our heads; enticed by a new philosophy where we are supposed to maximise happiness — we continue to resist and reject change. Why embrace the future if it is this painful? Why become aware that our world is collapsing? To avoid a growing sense of helplessness and despair, we then run faster towards that light at the end of the tunnel. Instead of embracing the unknown, we become even more blinded by what we think we know. Companies only learn agility in order to increase productivity, grow their revenues and make more profit. Governments engage in stakeholder consultations but their conclusions, coincidentally, always happen to confirm the initial intentions of those in power. People are concerned about plastic in our oceans but they ignore why this issue has become so salient. We change in order to remain the same and this is not good enough to meet today’s challenges. As Einstein wrote in 1946, “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.” Utopian rationality In my teaching, I invite executives and directors to become smarter than rational. I do not propose to throw out rationality. Rather, I want to overcome a rationality that imposes itself upon a complex reality in a totalitarian fashion. To identify a goal, choose the best action to reach it, then measure the consequences and finally claim success once the task is done is not smart enough. In a world full of surprises, we need to dream beyond our goals if they are to have meaning. A sense of purpose is essential for long-term value creation, as the dream that drives our goals will ensure the relevance of work beyond the next quarter or business cycle. We also need to realise that we may not attain our goals, and that can be an opportunity because they may need to be changed. We should never be prisoners of our goals. Anchored in our values, we can appreciate where we are at present and have our eyes fully open. Instead of serving a system that is at risk of destroying our humanity, we should make sure to put the framework of rationality to the service of our values and dreams. It is also a powerful strategic exercise. At INSEAD, my experience is that the building of a utopia allows executives and directors to free their minds from confining intellectual prejudices. The method draws from the three core principles of Wise Power: duality of mind, emotional maturity and generosity of soul. It is a way of thinking, feeling and dreaming that enhances our ability to meet the world half-way. It is especially useful for important and difficult decisions. Wise power consists of the ability to face surprising, even unpleasant truths bravely and honestly, although they may directly contradict our firmly held beliefs and preferences. Wise leaders are much less susceptible to the fear of the unknown that underlies defensiveness, because they perceive the deeper dynamics of the landscape around them. Instead of being fixated on the light at the end of the tunnel, they learn to pause and see that the tunnel is in fact made of beautiful trees, each of which is also a door to another space where they can discover, learn or just be. How to generate a utopia? Now more than ever, strategic business decisions must be taken in light of other realms of power. It is thus essential that utopias encompass the political, social, technological and natural spheres, as well as business. This allows leaders to embrace the growing expectations of multiple stakeholders across myriad issues. Complex, ambiguous grey zones have a perfect right to exist in these utopias. For example, you do not have to choose between business having freedom to operate, and governments possessing scope to regulate – you can have both. As participants present their utopias in class, it is liberating for them to express these contradictions. Executives are typically constrained in a discourse where business interests dictate everything. However, they are also citizens eager to exist more fully and freely at work. As they share their utopias and listen to others’, they become conscious of common predominant themes: a form of social equality, a government that cares for the common good, technology at the service of humans and not the other way around, and harmony with nature, among others. These commonalities transform what might have seemed an exercise in fanciful idealism into something highly relevant to the everyday exercise of executive power. The unthinkable suddenly becomes almost feasible. The lines between utopianism and executives’ habitual “realism” begin to blur. Why utopia? Peel back the layers of realism, and you will often find cynicism and pessimism feeding fear a steady diet of rationalisation, e.g. the world is so corrupt, boldly engaging with it is useless. Some cynicism and pessimism can also be valuable. Life is not black and white -- and we also need to tame some messianic tendencies that bring us back to the authoritarian form of leadership that we want to transform. , in terms of what could be. It gives us the courage and confidence to see the distance between reality and our dreams as a space of opportunity rather than ipso facto defeat. Applications of utopia Utopian thinking can be open-ended, but it can also be tailored to address specific business problems. I have used it to find solutions for a multinational energy company facing a disastrous situation. The company was heavily criticised in the media for its role in the environmental devastation and worsening quality of life of local communities. In response to being painted as villains in the press, executives had adopted a stance of denial of their responsibility. Their relationships with community leaders and government officials were at an impasse. By inviting participants to conceive of the best resolution imaginable for such conflicts, we foster within them an appetite for the unknown. They start envisioning ways to use their companies’ wealth and power for mutual value creation, together with locals on the ground. Most importantly, they become more aware of the pitfalls of a confrontational non-market strategy. Instead of maintaining the belief that they can save the world if they become a force for good (another way to remain in the ego-driven authoritarian form of leadership), companies can cultivate a global vision in which they interact with other forms of power in a more respectful and harmonious manner. Imagining utopias can also be useful for established organisations in the midst of market flux. For instance, a session on utopian thinking applied to the future of mobility allowed executives of a car manufacturer to better appreciate the multiple facets and layers of their situation. Rather than being constrained by the established discourse and culture of their company, they could engage at different levels and discuss the deeper changes driving the shifts in their industry. They were developing a sense of where they stood within this larger ecosystem and could find new levers to shape their culture and their identity. Instead of nurturing fear and helplessness, their uncertain future provided meaning. Developing utopia You do not need to wait for other people to apply utopian thinking. You can start yourself as an individual. Just think of a high-level challenge facing your organisation, industry, or even the nation or region in which you do business. Then apply your imagination to the problem, working through the different perspectives of the relevant stakeholders. Do not fear contradictions and allow space for the commonalities of good intentions and diversity of values. As a transformation of your own mind-set, the exercise will teach you to fear less and embrace more. You can scale up the benefit by involving your team – sharing your ideas with them and adding their contributions until a collective utopia emerges. This dream will help you select your objectives and identify the key stakeholders that can help you. It will also change your attitude to the world. Less afraid to envision change, you will look for opportunities to contribute to a better world beyond strict business objectives.'}, {'title': \"The power of utopian thinking: it's not just for naïve dreamers\", 'url': 'https://bigthink.com/thinking/thomas-more-power-utopian-thinking/', 'content': 'Sign up for the Smarter Faster newsletter A weekly newsletter featuring the biggest ideas from the smartest people Notice: JavaScript is required for this content. What would the perfect society look like to you? Try, if you can, to put aside how things are or what you think “has to be” the case, and just imagine your best possible world. What would the people be like? What jobs would people do? Who would get paid the most or live in the best houses? Would there even be money? Would there be any crime? Why not? Sometimes a bit of utopian thinking is vitally important, and the very word (if not the idea) goes back to the 16th century intellectual, Thomas More. The land of milk and honey More’s Utopia introduces a narrator who meets a traveller from the island of “Utopia.” This Utopian tells us about a perfect society, free from any inequality and violence. It is a place with no private property or unequal distribution of goods between the various segments of society. It is a place where jobs are divided fairly among the populace. It is a confederated city-state where violence is abhorred and is the worst of taboos and where “all men zealously pursue the good of the public.” In Utopia, precious metals have lost their luster. This is done by deliberate negative association — the condemned are made to wear gold coronets or earrings as a shaming ritual. Toilets and tables are made of gold, making them so commonplace that no one would desire them to the point of harming another to attain them. Iron is much the more valued metal because it has a practical and useful role to play. Why would anyone want gaudy stones or overly malleable metals? Wealth is, instead, measured in “cheerfulness, peace of mind, and freedom from anxiety.” Yet, there is a sinister aspect to this egalitarianism. If someone tries to leave the country, they are first imprisoned. If they try it again, they are turned into slaves. All the streets are identical, and after ten years, everyone has to swap houses by lot. All doors are open, and anyone can come and go as they please. Nothing is yours and nothing is mine. There’s No-Place like Utopia Ask two scholars why More wrote Utopia, and you will get two different answers. By one interpretation, it is subversive and revolutionary. In a post-Marx world, it is impossible to read Utopia without seeing the parallels to communism. Marx himself did occasionally make reference to More in a historical context but not to the ideas in Utopia. Engels and Marx regarded their work as a kind of socioeconomic science and would hate to have been labelled as “utopian.” They viewed such “utopian socialists” as selling only “castles in the air” that could never help the proletariat. While More’s Utopia would not be revolutionary in a Marxist sense, it would have been hugely contentious in its day. At the time More was writing — in a world of absolute monarchs, feudal peasants, and religious extremism — the ideas of egalitarianism and religious freedom were dangerously controversial. In another interpretation, some see Utopia as being mocking and satirical. It could be that Utopia is so extreme at times as to become an absurdity or a parody. The Utopian world is portrayed as overbearing and invasive, and, in some respects, at odds with human nature. It could be that More was really saying, “Look at these crazy ideas — they’re nonsense!” This interpretation looks more likely when we realize that Utopia literally means “no-place,” the traveller’s name (Hythloday) means “nonsense,” and the capital (Amaurot) means “City of No Inhabitants.” Utopian thinking: not just for dreamers But even this interpretation does not quite fit. Utopia is a provocation. It is an open question to us, the reader, about how society should be ordered. It inverts everything we assume and asks how things could be different. (And everything really could be different .) It is a thought experiment that throws much at the wall, and we are left to see what sticks. Today, we live with the idea of utopianism, and we all have our own versions of Utopia. Is it one of science fiction, with humans living in distant galaxies? Is it one of nanotech and advanced AI? Is it one of a return to nature and respect for the environment? Is it communistic or anarchic? Is it the nostalgic golden age of the conservative or the quixotic idealism of a college sophomore? There are as many Utopias as there are people, but what makes someone’s Utopia is not the point. Utopianism is the bold and brave voice that challenges the status quo. The act of questioning brings about change. Utopianism is what dares to imagine a world that could be better. It is the forward path, lined with cynics and pessimists who ridicule the dreamers. Perhaps the best way to view Utopia, and utopian thinking generally, is like a rainbow. The closer we move to it, the further it moves away. Although we will never reach it, its existence impels us to move forward. Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford. He runs a popular Instagram account called Mini Philosophy (@ philosophyminis ).

It’s the set of books that I read when I was in my early 20s, back when I was finishing my undergraduate degree and going on to postgraduate studies. Although I have read many more books since then, those books hold a special place in my heart. I read them at a formative stage in my life: when I was first developing my philosophical views. I probably remember more about those books than I do about the ones I have read in the last three or four years. This past week, when I was home again for the Christmas break, I picked up one of the books that had quite an influence on me when I first read it: Karl Popper’s Conjectures and Refutations . I was very interested in the philosophy of science at the time and Popper was a giant in the field. But Popper’s philosophical interests extended well beyond the philosophy of science. He defended a general theory of knowledge, based on the acceptance of profound uncertainty, that he used to resolve some classic problems in epistemology (e.g. Hume’s problem of induction) and to develop a distinctive political ethos. I was never much interested in Popper’s political philosophy when I first read his work, but when I picked up the book again over the Christmas break I decided to take a look at the more political essays. One, in particular, caught my eye. It was his essay on ‘Utopianism and Violence’. I have recently developed an interest in utopian theory — it’s part of a book project that I am currently working on — and I am eager to read anything about it. Popper was a critic of utopian theories, believing that many of famous utopian works in philosophy (like those of Plato and Marx) were dangerously authoritarian. What I want to do in the remainder of this post is to analyse and evaluate the argument against utopianism that Popper presents in this essay. It’s not a particularly rigorous presentation, but there are some interesting titbits, and it does espouse a popular concern about utopianism. The argument itself comes in two parts. The first part is a critique of the violent impulse that lies at the heart of utopianism; the second is a defence of an alternative, anti-utopian view. I want to see how well the logic of both parts holds up. 1. Does Utopianism Lead to Violence? It would probably help if we started with some clear sense of what ‘utopianism’ is. This is not easy since people use the term to refer to different things: a set of views in political philosophy, a description of historical political and social movements, a genre of literature, and so on. Fortunately, Popper provides us with his own preferred definition. He says that ‘utopianism’ is the political philosophy according to which: [W]e must first attempt to become as clear as possible about our ultimate political ends and only afterwards can we begin to determine the means which may best help us to realise this state. ( Conjectures and Refutations , 481) I have seen this referred to elsewhere as the ‘teleological’ or ‘blueprint’ model of utopianism. It is the notion that we must first sketch the blueprint for the ideal society and then work out how to get there. Popper’s major critique of blueprint utopianism is that it leads to violence. This is something that appears to be borne out by the historical evidence, but Popper wants to go beyond historical evidence in his argument. He claims that there is an impulse to violence that is inherent to all blueprint utopian movements. The impulse to violence is the natural consequence of three fundamental assumptions. These assumptions form the backbone of Popper’s argument. I will call them the ‘plurality assumption’, the ‘conflict assumption’, and the ‘irrationality assumption’ respectively. Knitting them together into a logical argument, I take it that Popper’s case against utopianism looks something like this: (1) Plurality assumption : Humans have different preferred ultimate ends (i.e. different groups have different conceptions of utopia). (2) Conflict assumption : On at least some occasions (and perhaps many) the different utopian visions come into direct conflict, i.e. it is not possible to realise one vision without eliminating another. (3) Irrationality assumption: It is not always possible to resolve these conflicts by rational means; oftentimes violence is the only way to eliminate the conflict. (4) Therefore, utopianism oftentimes leads to violence. The conclusion is somewhat modest. The claim is not that utopianism always and everywhere leads to violence, but simply that it has a tendency to do so. Furthermore, the plurality and conflict assumptions are reasonably uncontroversial: it seems obviously true to say that people have different conceptions of the ideal society and that these conceptions can conflict. Think about the conflict between communists and anarcho-capitalists or between secular humanists and radical Islamists. Each is, according to its supporters, utopian, but they are hardly compatible. That said, plurality and conflict by themselves need not lead to violence. If there were some objective hierarchy of value, that could be agreed upon by all, it may be possible to resolve the conflicts by rational argument. This is exactly what Popper disputes with the irrationality assumption. His case for this assumption rests on the belief that values are not subject to scientific investigation and analysis. This means they are not open to the same kind of objective (or intersubjective) agreement: [S]ince we cannot determine the ultimate ends of political action scientifically, or by purely rational methods, differences of opinion concerning what the ideal state should look like cannot always be smoothed out by the method of argument. ( Conjectures and Refutations , p. 483) This might strike you as a self-defeating claim. Popper himself concedes that rational argument is not completely out of bounds in the political arena. He acknowledges that what he is trying to do in his essay is present rational arguments against utopianism, which he hopes will persuade many people. This suggests that it might be possible — however improbable in practice it may be — for people to actually rationally coordinate on some blueprint for an ideal society at a particular moment in time. Does this possibility hold some hope for the utopian? Popper says ‘no’. He has another argument that deals with this scenario. This argument is a slight variation on the first one, focusing on how values can change over time: (5) The ultimate aims/ends of society can change over time, i.e. what seemed desirable to a group of people at T 1 may seem much less desirable at T 2 . (6) It would completely undermine any utopian project to allow for such changes in value over time: the purpose of a utopian project is to realise a particular blueprint for society. (7) Therefore, utopians will have an incentive to stamp out new alternative views, and they will do this by means of violence. This argument is logically looser than the first. There is something of a leap from the premises to the conclusion. Nevertheless, I believe my reconstruction is fair to what Popper says in his essay. He has an enthymematic style of presentation that leaves some of the key premises unstated. Furthermore, the logical leap to the conclusion is shortened, somewhat, when we learn that Popper’s definition of violence includes “propaganda, the suppression of criticism and the annihilation of opposition”. In other words, it’s not just kidnapping and assassination that counts as violence. This, however, leads me to two criticisms of Popper’s argument. The first is concerned with his definition of violence. I think Popper may be over-extending the definition of violence and as a consequence may be misdiagnosing the problem with utopianism. As Aldous Huxley famously said to George Orwell , what is likely going to be truly insidious about utopian (or ‘dystopian’ - the line between the two is thin) societies is not that they use violence to enforce their preferred vision, but that they use techniques of mind control to get you to agree with their vision. People won’t be afraid to express their true opinion for fear of retaliation from the regime; they will wholeheartedly agree with what the regime has to say. Now, to be clear, I think there is something less than ideal about such a society, but I don’t think it is because it leads to violence. I think it is problematic because of how it impacts on freedom of thought and autonomy. This suggests to me that ‘violence’ is not always the most appropriate concept to use to critique utopianism. The second criticism, which is perhaps more significant, has to do with how Popper defines utopianism. He defines it as having a blueprint for the ideal society, fully formed, before one embarks on a political project. We could accept his definition as being purely stipulative, in which case his claims about the use of violence and suppression by a utopian regime might be plausible. But this would then cause us to overlook another prominent strand of utopian thought: the one that does not sketch out detailed blueprints for the ideal society, but rather thinks in terms of expanding frontiers of progress. There is a famous Oscar Wilde quote that captures this sentiment: A map of the world that does not include utopia is not even worth glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always landing. And when humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of utopias. This progressive conception of utopianism would be more tolerant of the shifting sands of opinion over time. This might stem the impulse to violence that Popper sees in the utopian outlook. (This is not to mention the ‘meta-utopian’ philosophy of Robert Nozick , which is explicitly designed to address the problems of plurality and conflict). 2. What Political Ideals are Appropriate? Popper goes beyond mere critique in his essay. Although dismissive of utopian projects, he wants to maintain some role for idealism in the political sphere. Indeed, Popper has an optimistic bent when it comes to the future. From whence does this optimism spring? It is here that Popper’s ‘negative utilitarianism’ rears its head. Popper does not think that society should aim at realising optimal states of happiness and well-being in the future; rather, he thinks we should try to eliminate ‘concrete evils’ in the here and now. The elimination of such evils is all we need for political idealism (of a sort) to flourish. You might wonder whether this ‘elimination of concrete evils’-strategy is substantially different from blueprint utopianism. Popper argues that it is. He does so for largely epistemic reasons, two of which figure prominently in his essay. These form quasi-independent lines of support for his political project. (5) We have better knowledge/understanding of what it takes to eliminate concrete evils because we have direct and immediate acquaintance with them; we only know ideal situations through, often vague, imaginings. (6) There is far greater intersubjective agreement about the most serious concrete evils than there is about ideal societies. (7) Therefore, we ought to focus on eliminating concrete evils, not on blueprint utopianism. There is something to be said for the premises of this argument. Concrete evils exist in the here and now. They are not merely hypothetical or potential. There are people suffering from war, disease, famine, displacement and so on. Even if we ourselves are not suffering, we can easily gain epistemic access to the suffering of others (if we are willing to expose ourselves to it). No one has similarly direct acquaintance with an ideal society. Furthermore, many people agree on the major ‘concrete evils’ that exist in the world today. That said, I’m much less optimistic than Popper is on both of these fronts. I think there are two objections to his line of thinking. First, I think the distance between the elimination of evils and the realisation of ideals is shorter than he seems to think. Indeed, you could argue that identifying a concrete evil carries, by some necessary implication, an agreement on an ideal. In other words, if X is a concrete evil, then not-X (or the opposite of X or denial of X) is going to be a necessary element in the blueprint for an ideal society. If you draw together enough not-Xs, you might come up with something that looks an awful lot like a utopian political project. To be fair, though, I think there is some conceptual distinction between the elimination of concrete evils and the realisation of ideals. If we take it that ‘great physical pain’ is a concrete evil, then the opposite of this (the ideal state) would be something like ‘great physical pleasure/joy’. It might seem like in identifying the concrete evil you, necessarily, develop a conception of the ideal. Nevertheless, trying to eliminate great physical pain, does not, by itself, mean that you are trying to bring about great physical pleasure. There is an intermediate state of being — one in which pain is absent — that you are trying to bring about. This is illustrated in the diagram below. Popper could argue that his political project is about aiming for these intermediate states, and so could deny the charge that it amounts to the same thing as utopianism. This, however, leads me to the second objection to Popper’s argument. I think his argument is vulnerable to the same criticisms about conflict and plurality, and dynamic change, that he threw at blueprint utopianism. For one thing, I’m not at all convinced, as Popper seems to be, that there is widespread agreement on the most important concrete evils facing society today. Popper was writing in the mid-20th century when there may have been more agreement about this, particularly in the West, but I think that time has past. Just as there are incompatible hierarchies of value thwarting utopian projects, so too are there incompatible hierarchies of disvalue thwarting negative utilitarian projects. Different groups often disagree about what deserves priority. Furthermore, what counts as a concrete evil shifts over time. Once upon a time bullying and sexual harassment wouldn’t have got a look in when it came to identifying society’s greatest challenges; nowadays they are front and centre. Ironically, I think this leads Popper to develop a utopian philosophy of his own, albeit one that is closer to the progressive model that I identified at the end of the last section. One of Popper’s main problems with blueprint utopianism seems to be that it treats current social orders as ‘mere means’ to an end. This can justify great evils. His preferred approach — progressive negative utilitarianism — doesn’t make this mistake: We must not argue that a certain social situation is a mere means to an end on the grounds that it is a merely historical situation. For all situations are transient. ( Conjectures and Refutations , 486) We should instead aim to eliminate currently identified concrete evils and, if and when we succeed with this, move on to newly identified evils. In this manner we can progressively asymptote towards a more ‘ideal’ society, without ever fixating on a particular blueprint or model. I think there is some wisdom in this idea.'}]"

The term itself originated from Thomas More's 1516 work, *Utopia*, meaning 'no place' in Greek.\\n\\n2. **Ideals of Governance**: In a utopia, governance often reflects collective ethics, with rulers chosen for their wisdom and benevolence, rather than through force or privilege. This contrasts sharply with contemporary societies where such principles may be lacking.\\n\\n3. **Common Ownership and Equality**: Utopian societies frequently envision common ownership of property and resources, reflecting an ideal where wealth disparity is non-existent, allowing all individuals to thrive equally.\\n\\n4. **Moral and Ethical Underpinnings**: Utopian thought is grounded in moral and ethical considerations, seeking not just practical changes but deeper social and philosophical ideals, often informed by reason and intelligence.\\n\\n5. **Critique of Current Society**: Utopianism inherently involves a critique of existing social conditions, highlighting injustices, inequalities, and ethical failings, while proposing radical alternatives designed to rectify these issues.\\n\\n6. **Cultural Dimensions**: Utopian narratives often explore themes of cultural and religious coexistence, emphasizing tolerance and harmony among diverse beliefs.\\n\\n7. **Historical Influence**: The tradition of utopian thought builds on earlier myths of a 'Golden Age', evolving through time with contributions from various philosophers and social theorists, which reflect changing societal values and aspirations.\\n\\n8. **Positive Social Change**: Utopianism aims to inspire real social reform, touching upon economic, political, and psychological transformations that encourage human flourishing beyond current limitations.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"node_id\": \"Q.2\",\n      \"question\": \"What historical examples exist of utopian societies?\",\n      \"annotation\": \"Historically, several utopian societies have been established, particularly in the United States.

These utopias have socialist dimensions and involve collective ownership or control. In this chapter and the next two, I will concentrate on, and investigate in more detail, key themes from that discussion: utopianism, socialism, and economic democracy. In this chapter, I will focus on utopianism, especially on criticisms of it from Marxist and liberal points of view. Utopianism aims for somewhere better. Getting there, to the alternative society, requires change. This chapter focuses on limits to utopianism’s capacity for social change, according to its critics. From one Marxist point of view, but not all as we shall see, utopianism is idealist and steps aside from material and conflictual dimensions of society and so undermines change. Utopia avoids or undermines engagement with material reality and conflicts that lead to change. But I think utopias can be material and conflictual and contribute to change. Materialist and conflict criticisms of utopianism can be answered from a materialist and conflict perspective. I will also look at liberal and pluralist criticisms that utopianism is totalitarian, endist, and terminates diversity and change. Where utopia has been achieved, it seems totalitarian and against freedom and pluralism, because it implies that something different from the utopia is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, if the perfect society has been reached, then it is against change, because change is no longer required. But in my view, utopianism can be free, plural, and dynamic rather than static. Utopias do not have to be final ends. They can involve criticism and diversity, which lead to change and make utopias processes and not ends. So, utopianism can be defended against liberal and pluralist criticisms, with freedom and pluralist points of view rather than by rejecting such perspectives. Utopias and change Thomas More (1892) is credited with inventing the word ‘utopia’, the title of his 16th-century novel. It refers to components from ancient Greek that mean something good ( eu ) but not ( ou ) a place ( topos ).'}, {'title': \"Popper's Critique of Utopianism and Defence of Negative ... - Blogger\", 'url': 'https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com/2018/01/poppers-critique-of-utopianism-and.html', 'content': 'Every year when I go home for Christmas, I revisit my old library. It’s the set of books that I read when I was in my early 20s, back when I was finishing my undergraduate degree and going on to postgraduate studies. Although I have read many more books since then, those books hold a special place in my heart. I read them at a formative stage in my life: when I was first developing my philosophical views. I probably remember more about those books than I do about the ones I have read in the last three or four years. This past week, when I was home again for the Christmas break, I picked up one of the books that had quite an influence on me when I first read it: Karl Popper’s Conjectures and Refutations . I was very interested in the philosophy of science at the time and Popper was a giant in the field. But Popper’s philosophical interests extended well beyond the philosophy of science. He defended a general theory of knowledge, based on the acceptance of profound uncertainty, that he used to resolve some classic problems in epistemology (e.g. Hume’s problem of induction) and to develop a distinctive political ethos. I was never much interested in Popper’s political philosophy when I first read his work, but when I picked up the book again over the Christmas break I decided to take a look at the more political essays. One, in particular, caught my eye. It was his essay on ‘Utopianism and Violence’. I have recently developed an interest in utopian theory — it’s part of a book project that I am currently working on — and I am eager to read anything about it. Popper was a critic of utopian theories, believing that many of famous utopian works in philosophy (like those of Plato and Marx) were dangerously authoritarian. What I want to do in the remainder of this post is to analyse and evaluate the argument against utopianism that Popper presents in this essay. It’s not a particularly rigorous presentation, but there are some interesting titbits, and it does espouse a popular concern about utopianism. The argument itself comes in two parts. The first part is a critique of the violent impulse that lies at the heart of utopianism; the second is a defence of an alternative, anti-utopian view. I want to see how well the logic of both parts holds up. 1. Does Utopianism Lead to Violence? It would probably help if we started with some clear sense of what ‘utopianism’ is. This is not easy since people use the term to refer to different things: a set of views in political philosophy, a description of historical political and social movements, a genre of literature, and so on. Fortunately, Popper provides us with his own preferred definition. He says that ‘utopianism’ is the political philosophy according to which: [W]e must first attempt to become as clear as possible about our ultimate political ends and only afterwards can we begin to determine the means which may best help us to realise this state. ( Conjectures and Refutations , 481) I have seen this referred to elsewhere as the ‘teleological’ or ‘blueprint’ model of utopianism. It is the notion that we must first sketch the blueprint for the ideal society and then work out how to get there. Popper’s major critique of blueprint utopianism is that it leads to violence. This is something that appears to be borne out by the historical evidence, but Popper wants to go beyond historical evidence in his argument. He claims that there is an impulse to violence that is inherent to all blueprint utopian movements. The impulse to violence is the natural consequence of three fundamental assumptions. These assumptions form the backbone of Popper’s argument. I will call them the ‘plurality assumption’, the ‘conflict assumption’, and the ‘irrationality assumption’ respectively. Knitting them together into a logical argument, I take it that Popper’s case against utopianism looks something like this: (1) Plurality assumption : Humans have different preferred ultimate ends (i.e. different groups have different conceptions of utopia). (2) Conflict assumption : On at least some occasions (and perhaps many) the different utopian visions come into direct conflict, i.e. it is not possible to realise one vision without eliminating another. (3) Irrationality assumption: It is not always possible to resolve these conflicts by rational means; oftentimes violence is the only way to eliminate the conflict. (4) Therefore, utopianism oftentimes leads to violence. The conclusion is somewhat modest. The claim is not that utopianism always and everywhere leads to violence, but simply that it has a tendency to do so. Furthermore, the plurality and conflict assumptions are reasonably uncontroversial: it seems obviously true to say that people have different conceptions of the ideal society and that these conceptions can conflict. Think about the conflict between communists and anarcho-capitalists or between secular humanists and radical Islamists. Each is, according to its supporters, utopian, but they are hardly compatible. That said, plurality and conflict by themselves need not lead to violence. If there were some objective hierarchy of value, that could be agreed upon by all, it may be possible to resolve the conflicts by rational argument. This is exactly what Popper disputes with the irrationality assumption. His case for this assumption rests on the belief that values are not subject to scientific investigation and analysis. This means they are not open to the same kind of objective (or intersubjective) agreement: [S]ince we cannot determine the ultimate ends of political action scientifically, or by purely rational methods, differences of opinion concerning what the ideal state should look like cannot always be smoothed out by the method of argument. ( Conjectures and Refutations , p. 483) This might strike you as a self-defeating claim. Popper himself concedes that rational argument is not completely out of bounds in the political arena. He acknowledges that what he is trying to do in his essay is present rational arguments against utopianism, which he hopes will persuade many people. This suggests that it might be possible — however improbable in practice it may be — for people to actually rationally coordinate on some blueprint for an ideal society at a particular moment in time. Does this possibility hold some hope for the utopian? Popper says ‘no’. He has another argument that deals with this scenario. This argument is a slight variation on the first one, focusing on how values can change over time: (5) The ultimate aims/ends of society can change over time, i.e. what seemed desirable to a group of people at T 1 may seem much less desirable at T 2 . (6) It would completely undermine any utopian project to allow for such changes in value over time: the purpose of a utopian project is to realise a particular blueprint for society. (7) Therefore, utopians will have an incentive to stamp out new alternative views, and they will do this by means of violence. This argument is logically looser than the first. There is something of a leap from the premises to the conclusion. Nevertheless, I believe my reconstruction is fair to what Popper says in his essay. He has an enthymematic style of presentation that leaves some of the key premises unstated. Furthermore, the logical leap to the conclusion is shortened, somewhat, when we learn that Popper’s definition of violence includes “propaganda, the suppression of criticism and the annihilation of opposition”. In other words, it’s not just kidnapping and assassination that counts as violence. This, however, leads me to two criticisms of Popper’s argument. The first is concerned with his definition of violence. I think Popper may be over-extending the definition of violence and as a consequence may be misdiagnosing the problem with utopianism. As Aldous Huxley famously said to George Orwell , what is likely going to be truly insidious about utopian (or ‘dystopian’ - the line between the two is thin) societies is not that they use violence to enforce their preferred vision, but that they use techniques of mind control to get you to agree with their vision. People won’t be afraid to express their true opinion for fear of retaliation from the regime; they will wholeheartedly agree with what the regime has to say. Now, to be clear, I think there is something less than ideal about such a society, but I don’t think it is because it leads to violence. I think it is problematic because of how it impacts on freedom of thought and autonomy. This suggests to me that ‘violence’ is not always the most appropriate concept to use to critique utopianism. The second criticism, which is perhaps more significant, has to do with how Popper defines utopianism. He defines it as having a blueprint for the ideal society, fully formed, before one embarks on a political project. We could accept his definition as being purely stipulative, in which case his claims about the use of violence and suppression by a utopian regime might be plausible. But this would then cause us to overlook another prominent strand of utopian thought: the one that does not sketch out detailed blueprints for the ideal society, but rather thinks in terms of expanding frontiers of progress. There is a famous Oscar Wilde quote that captures this sentiment: A map of the world that does not include utopia is not even worth glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always landing. And when humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of utopias. This progressive conception of utopianism would be more tolerant of the shifting sands of opinion over time. This might stem the impulse to violence that Popper sees in the utopian outlook. (This is not to mention the ‘meta-utopian’ philosophy of Robert Nozick , which is explicitly designed to address the problems of plurality and conflict). 2. What Political Ideals are Appropriate? Popper goes beyond mere critique in his essay. Although dismissive of utopian projects, he wants to maintain some role for idealism in the political sphere. Indeed, Popper has an optimistic bent when it comes to the future. From whence does this optimism spring? It is here that Popper’s ‘negative utilitarianism’ rears its head. Popper does not think that society should aim at realising optimal states of happiness and well-being in the future; rather, he thinks we should try to eliminate ‘concrete evils’ in the here and now. The elimination of such evils is all we need for political idealism (of a sort) to flourish. You might wonder whether this ‘elimination of concrete evils’-strategy is substantially different from blueprint utopianism. Popper argues that it is. He does so for largely epistemic reasons, two of which figure prominently in his essay. These form quasi-independent lines of support for his political project. (5) We have better knowledge/understanding of what it takes to eliminate concrete evils because we have direct and immediate acquaintance with them; we only know ideal situations through, often vague, imaginings. (6) There is far greater intersubjective agreement about the most serious concrete evils than there is about ideal societies. (7) Therefore, we ought to focus on eliminating concrete evils, not on blueprint utopianism. There is something to be said for the premises of this argument. Concrete evils exist in the here and now. They are not merely hypothetical or potential. There are people suffering from war, disease, famine, displacement and so on. Even if we ourselves are not suffering, we can easily gain epistemic access to the suffering of others (if we are willing to expose ourselves to it). No one has similarly direct acquaintance with an ideal society. Furthermore, many people agree on the major ‘concrete evils’ that exist in the world today. That said, I’m much less optimistic than Popper is on both of these fronts. I think there are two objections to his line of thinking. First, I think the distance between the elimination of evils and the realisation of ideals is shorter than he seems to think. Indeed, you could argue that identifying a concrete evil carries, by some necessary implication, an agreement on an ideal. In other words, if X is a concrete evil, then not-X (or the opposite of X or denial of X) is going to be a necessary element in the blueprint for an ideal society. If you draw together enough not-Xs, you might come up with something that looks an awful lot like a utopian political project. To be fair, though, I think there is some conceptual distinction between the elimination of concrete evils and the realisation of ideals. If we take it that ‘great physical pain’ is a concrete evil, then the opposite of this (the ideal state) would be something like ‘great physical pleasure/joy’. It might seem like in identifying the concrete evil you, necessarily, develop a conception of the ideal. Nevertheless, trying to eliminate great physical pain, does not, by itself, mean that you are trying to bring about great physical pleasure. There is an intermediate state of being — one in which pain is absent — that you are trying to bring about. This is illustrated in the diagram below. Popper could argue that his political project is about aiming for these intermediate states, and so could deny the charge that it amounts to the same thing as utopianism. This, however, leads me to the second objection to Popper’s argument. I think his argument is vulnerable to the same criticisms about conflict and plurality, and dynamic change, that he threw at blueprint utopianism. For one thing, I’m not at all convinced, as Popper seems to be, that there is widespread agreement on the most important concrete evils facing society today. Popper was writing in the mid-20th century when there may have been more agreement about this, particularly in the West, but I think that time has past. Just as there are incompatible hierarchies of value thwarting utopian projects, so too are there incompatible hierarchies of disvalue thwarting negative utilitarian projects. Different groups often disagree about what deserves priority. Furthermore, what counts as a concrete evil shifts over time. Once upon a time bullying and sexual harassment wouldn’t have got a look in when it came to identifying society’s greatest challenges; nowadays they are front and centre. Ironically, I think this leads Popper to develop a utopian philosophy of his own, albeit one that is closer to the progressive model that I identified at the end of the last section. One of Popper’s main problems with blueprint utopianism seems to be that it treats current social orders as ‘mere means’ to an end. This can justify great evils. His preferred approach — progressive negative utilitarianism — doesn’t make this mistake: We must not argue that a certain social situation is a mere means to an end on the grounds that it is a merely historical situation. For all situations are transient. ( Conjectures and Refutations , 486) We should instead aim to eliminate currently identified concrete evils and, if and when we succeed with this, move on to newly identified evils. In this manner we can progressively asymptote towards a more ‘ideal’ society, without ever fixating on a particular blueprint or model. I think there is some wisdom in this idea.'}, {'title': 'Utopianism as a political ideology: An attempt at redefinition', 'url': 'https://www.ideology-theory-practice.org/blog/utopianism-as-a-political-ideology-an-attempt-at-redefinition', 'content': 'Is utopianism an \"ideology\", in the loose sense of a coherent system of ideas, and if so where does it sit on the traditional spectrum of right-to-left ideas? Or does the \"ism\" merely describe a process of dreaming or speculating about ideal societies which in principle can never exist, as common language definitions usually imply? The former conception is relatively unproblematic, if too easily reduced to a psychological principle and then deemed deviant or pathological. Presuming the \"ism\" to imply the quest to attain or implement \"utopia\", however, we still encounter a vast number of often contradictory definitions, ranging from the common-language \"impossible\", \"unrealistic\", or without reasonable grounds to be supposed attainable, to \"idealist\" (as opposed to \"realist\"), to the \"no-where\" of Thomas More\\'s original text, Utopia (1516), and its attendant pun, the \"good place\", or eutopia. Much confusion has resulted from inadequately separating these various definitions, two particular aspects of which, the non-existent/unreachable, and the realisable, are seemingly contradictory. The \"ism\" is often divided today into three \"faces\", as Lyman Tower Sargent first termed them: utopian social theory, literary utopias and dystopias, and utopian practice. [1] This typology is shared by another leading theorist, Krishan Kumar. [2] On this reckoning, one definition of utopian ideology would simply be utopian social theory, regardless of how we define the destination or ideal society itself, and whether it purports to be realistic or realisable, or remains an imagined ideal or norm which serves to inform action but which cannot be in principle be attained, because it continues to move forward even as its original vision comes to fruition. This approach allows us to describe every major ideology as harbouring its own utopia, or ideal type of self-realisation, while acknowledging the brand with varying degrees of reluctance. Modern liberalism, usually averse to the utopian label where it seemingly implies human perfectibility, might be supposed to entertain an ideal framed around free trade, private property, increasing opulence, and democracy. [3] Its most extreme form lies in the promise of eventual universal opulence. But it can extend further leftwards, for instance with the self-proclaimed utopian John Stuart Mill, towards socialism and much greater equality, as well as rightwards, with less state action to remedy inequality, as in libertarianism or neoliberalism. [4] Modern conservatism differs little from this, having yoked itself to commercial progress in the nineteenth century, though it sometimes retains deference to traditional elites, and greater aversion to democracy. Fascism certainly possesses utopian qualities, some rooted in the past and others in ideas of the future. Socialism inherits the Morean paradigm, with communism closer to More, and social democracy to liberalism. A specifically utopian ideology is thus more or less linked to More\\'s paradigm of social equality, common property, substantial communal living, contempt for luxury, and a general practice of civic virtue. This can be termed utopian republicanism, and its origins traced to Spartan, Cretan, Platonic theory and Christian monastic practice. [5] Within this typology, to advert to Karl Mannheim\\'s famous distinction in Ideology and Utopia (1936), we can also speak of utopianism having generally a critical function, and ideology a defensive one, vis-à-vis the status quo and class interest. [6] This involves a less neutral definition of ideology, not a system of ideas as such, but much closer to Marx\\'s definition in the German Ideology (1845-6). These approaches to the utopian components in major ideologies are perfectly serviceable. They help to tease out the ultimate aspirations of systems of political ideas, as well as to reveal their whimsicalities and shortcomings. They give us a distinctive sense of More\\'s paradigm of utopian republicanism, and of the continuity of one strand of political thought from Plato to Marx and beyond. They also reveal the more prominent role often played by fiction in the expression of utopianism compared to more overtly political ideologies. Nonetheless existing accounts of utopianism often leave us with two problems. Firstly, they do not reconcile the differences between the imaginary and realistic aspects of utopian ideals by adequately differentiating between the main functions of the concept. Secondly, they do not allow us to consider what the three \"faces\" share in common by way of content, or what the common goal of utopian movements, practices, and ideas alike might consist in. Let us briefly consider how these two problems might be solved. [7] Clearly ideal societies portrayed in literature and projected in social and political theory share much in common. Both are imaginary and textual, and sometimes only a thin veneer of fiction separates literary from theoretical forms of portraying ideas, particularly where \"novels of ideas\" are concerned. The chief definitional problem arises here from including the third, practical component. How should we categorise the content of utopian practice? That is, how do we describe what happens when people think their way of life actually approximates to utopia, rather than merely aspiring to it or dreaming of the benefits thereof? And how does this relate to the fictional and theoretical forms of utopianism? Utopian practice is usually conceived as communitarianism, or the foundation of intentional communities of mostly unrelated people who share common ideals. But it can also refer to other attempts to institutionalise the practices we associate with utopianism, most notably common or collectively-managed property, for example co-operation, or the promotion of solidarity in the workplace. Where the claim is made, we must cede to its proponents that what they practice is indeed a variant on the \"good society\", because they feel this is the case. That is to say, after a fashion, they have achieved, if only temporarily or conditionally, or in a relatively limited, perhaps \"heterotopian\", space, \"utopia\". [8] There is no contradiction between utopia possessing this realistic element and also implying the unrealisable if we concede that the concept serves a number of diverse purposes. It has historically had two main functions. One is to permit visionary social theory by hinting at possible futures on the basis of returning to lost or imaginary pasts, or extrapolating present trends to their logical conclusions. Once images of the Golden Age and Christian paradise served this purpose of providing an anchoring function, reminding us of what our original condition might have looked like, if for no other reason than to mock the follies and pretensions of the present and the fatuousness of any prospect of returning to a condition of natural liberty or primitive virtue. But from the late 18th century onwards utopianism began to turn towards future-oriented perfectibility, still conceived in terms of virtue, stability and social harmony, but now also more frequently linked to science and technology. So for the later modern period we can call this tendency towards imaginative projection the futurological function. By permitting us to think in terms of epochs and grand changes, the process allows us to burst asunder the bubbles of everyday life and push back the boundaries of the possible. It usually consists of one of two components. It may offer a blueprint, constitution, or programme which might actually be implemented. Or it may produce an image which allows us to criticise the present, but recedes like a mirage as we approach it, such that while we may realise past utopias we also constantly move the conceptual goal-posts, and our expectations of progress, forward. A second function of the idea of utopia is psychological, and is often addressed to explain the sources and motivation of utopian thinking. Here the concept satisfies an ingrained natural demand for progress or betterment, with which utopianism is often confused generically, and which corresponds to a personal mental space, a kind of interior greenhouse, in which the imagined improvements are conceived and nurtured. This function, associated with Martin Buber and even more Ernst Bloch, involves positing an ontological \"principle of hope\" or \"wish-picture\" where utopia functions to express a deep-seated longing for release from our anxieties. [9] This \"desire\" is sometimes regarded as the \"essence\" of utopianism. [10] This approach is often linked to religion, with which it has much in common, and in the early modern period with millenarianism in particular, and later with secular forms of millenarian thought. In Christianity both the Garden of Eden and Heaven function as ideal communities in which we participate at various levels. Our longings can be merely compensatory, alleviating the stress and anxiety of everyday life by positing a disappearance of our problems in any kind of displaced, idealised alterity. Here they may be non- or even anti-utopian, insofar as we wish our anxieties away by merely seeking distraction without social change. They may be satirical, mocking the pretensions of the wealthy and powerful. Or they may be emancipatory, demanding the alteration of reality to fit a higher ideal. This function permits escapism from oppressive everyday reality while also potentially fusing and igniting our desire for change. We can call this the alterity function, since it gives us a critical standpoint juxtaposed to our normal condition. Neither of these functions contradicts the prospect that utopia can be described as \"nowhere\" while also possessing a realistic dimension in communitarianism and other forms of utopian practice. They merely acknowledge the concept\\'s multidimensional nature. This can be clarified further if we consider the problem of the content of utopianism, that is, the common normative core of the three \"faces\", and ask what utopian writers actually seek to realise when they actually propose restructuring society. This is easily portrayed if we remain within the loose parameters of the Morean paradigm. The existence of common property and a more communal way of life is the core of this ideal, and is shared by many forms of socialism and communism as well as many literary depictions of utopia, the best-known later modern example being Edward Bellamy\\'s Looking Backward 2000-1887 (1888). Marx is of course its most famous non-literary expositor. Not all intentional communities have been communist, however. Charles Fourier, for example, proposed a reward for capitalist investors, who would receive a third, labour five-twelfths, and talent a quarter of any community\\'s profits. Anarchist and individualist communities have sometimes promoted much less collectivist modes of organisation and social life than their socialist counterparts. But these still retain a core ideal which unites their \"utopian\" aspirations. All are clearly more egalitarian than the societies for which they purport to offer an alternative. They are also, or aim to be, much more closely-knit. They offer what sociologists from Ferdinand Tönnies onwards have usually referred to as a Gemeinschaft form of community, where social bonds are far stronger than in the looser and more self-interested Gesellschaft type of association which dominates everyday urban capitalist life. These more intense bonds constitute an \"enhanced sociability\", which epitomises utopian aspiration. [11] Normatively, utopia in general thus presents the ideal type of a much more sociable society, where something akin to friendship links many if not most of the inhabitants, and the aspiration to achieve it. But we need to give this shared content greater depth, specificity, and clarity. Not only are there many different forms of friendship, which exhibit varying degrees of solidarity, mutuality or altruism. It is readily apparent that merely consorting with others is not as such the aim of sociability. That is, we do not seek friendship, camaraderie, and other forms of intimate association and closer bonding purely for the sake of that connection, and merely out of loneliness or boredom, important though such motivations are. We aim rather at satisfying a deeper need, which can be described in terms of an elementary desire for \"belongingness\". This is the goal, usually conceived in terms of group membership, for which sociability is the means, and which utopian \"hope\" chiefly aims at. It can be described as the antidote to that alienation so often associated with the moderns, and which was at the core of the problematic the young Marx grappled with. But much of the rest of modern sociology, philosophy and political theory bears out the point. To the sociologists Peter L. Berger, Brigitte Berger and Hansfried Kellner, the \"modern mind\" has been described as typically a \"homeless mind\", a condition \"psychologically hard to bear\" which induces a \"permanent identity crisis\". [12] Buried under the blizzard of impulses modern urban life creates, moving frequently and thus often uprooted, isolated, driven apart by the dominant ethos of individualism and competition, we feel we have lost both a unity with our community and a wholeness in our inner selves. Longing to retrieve both, we search accordingly for symbolic places where we imagine we once possessed such unity. Here a Heimat - the German term evokes a richness and depth of feeling lacking in English - or \"home\", now lost to some other group, or just to time, easily becomes the focus of imaginary virtues, peace and fulfilment. [13] This can be projected backwards or forwards, as well as to distant locations or even outer space. Where homesickness or Heimweh lacks a definitive, objective past or place upon which to focus, it may be preferable to conceive our imaginary home as a future utopia, where Heimatslosigkeit , the feeling of loss, is conquered. If such a word existed, \"homefulness\" would define this domain. Another German term, Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl , does part of the work of giving a sense of \"togetherness\" as well as belonging. \"Belongingness\" will do as well in English, and is a rich and somewhat open-ended concept which clearly invites greater scrutiny than is possible here. It enjoys a prominent position in modern group psychology, which is a key entry to point to the study of utopianism. [14] As elemental as \"our need for water\", Kelly-Ann Allen writes, it is so fundamental that its manifestations often passed unnoticed. [15] Some see the need to belong as the primordial source for our desire for power, intimacy, approval, and much else. It commences in infancy, drives our willingness to conform through life, and may haunt us in our dotage. It is reflected in an attachment to places as well as people, and extends by association to all our senses, including smell and taste. The sense of belonging or connectedness is a crucial component in solidarity, and is sometimes even portrayed as the basis of morality as such. [16] Everyone has experienced the anxiety of feeling alone, abandoned, ignored, friendless, rejected, shunned, dispossessed, displaced, foreign, alien, and alienated. Not being part of a group we aspire to join can be devastating. Exclusion cuts us to the bone. Not feeling part of a place also makes us uncomfortable and unwanted. By the effort to exclude others from the in-group, or \"othering\", belongingness can thus also play a fundamental role in the dystopian imagination. [17] So the aspiration for friendship, association, the feeling of neighbourliness, in a word belongingness, guides much of our behaviour through life. The condition of homelessness can inspire imaginary future ideal societies, and in utopian literary form has often done so during the past two centuries or so. But it also still often induces backward-looking perspectives. It \"has therefore engendered its own nostalgias - nostalgias, that is, for a condition of \\'being at home\\' in society, with oneself and, ultimately, in the universe\". [18] This endangers more accurate and balanced accounts by encouraging a nostalgic rewriting of history, where we hearken back to an imagined superior past, and redact unpleasant facts which interfere with this vision. This process corresponds to an unfortunate desire, of which we have been reminded far too often in the past few years, to want to be told things which please us rather than those whose truths make us feel uncomfortable, and which we would rather ignore or forget. We are happy to be lied to if the lie makes us feel better, and rationalist conceptions of the inevitable conquest of error by truth are thus misguided where they fail to acknowledge this weakness. This process is aided by the fact that memory is often faulty and selective, and we can concoct an ideal starting-point without worrying about its accuracy. The further back we go, too, the poorer are the records which might contradict us. This makes propaganda the more readily successful. This has a bearing on one ideology more than any other. Nationalism in particular often depends heavily on and can indeed be defined as an \"imagined community\", in Benedict Anderson\\'s well-known phrase, which makes it a distinctive form of utopian group. [19] It often adverts to periods when our nation was \"great\" and its enemies vanquished and subservient, and frequently demands a rewriting of history to accord with such narratives, as modern debates over imperialism and the statues of heroic conquerors and defenders of slavery make abundantly clear. To those not motivated by the search for more balanced stories, but who primarily seek ego reinforcement amidst their national identity crises, the glorious fictional history of the imagined nation is often preferable over its more likely inglorious and bloodstained real past. Whole nations feel a romantic nostalgia, \"a painful yearning to return home\", for their lost golden ages of innocence, virtue and equality, and for their mythical places of origin, or the peak of their global power and influence. [20] Denying the reality of the present and compensatory displacement are key here. But the same process occurs as nations age, become more urban and complex, and are more driven by capitalist competition, by consumerism and the anxiety to work ever harder. Personal relations suffer under all these forces. Increasingly, suggests Juliet B. Schor, we \"yearn for what we see as a simpler time, when people cared less about money and more about each other\". [21] Susan Stewart sees such nostalgia as a \"social disease\" which seeks \"an authenticity of being\" through presenting a new narrative, while denying the present. [22] We can readily see, then, that all major political ideologies advert to one or another glorious pasts or future images which recall or herald greater individual fulfilment, prosperity, and more powerful bonds of community. Not all address belongingness in the same manner, however. Liberalism tends from the early nineteenth century onwards to stress the value of individuality, and often under-theorises the need for and benefits of sociability. [23] Communitarian liberalism has made some effort to redress this omission, with varying degrees of success. Older forms of conservatism tended to locate the ideal state in the past and in more traditional systems of ranks, though this is not the case for more recent incarnations. Socialism is closest both semantically and programmatically to More\\'s original utopian paradigm, and places great stress on the effort to rebuild communities around various artificially-constructed ideas of sociability and solidarity. To that inveterate critic of utopian aspiration, Leszek Kolakowski, Marxism-Leninism in particular shared a desire with all utopians \"to institutionalize fraternity\", adding that \"an institutionally guaranteed friendship … is the surest way to totalitarian despotism\", since a \"conflictless order\" can only exist \"by applying totalitarian coercion\". [24] \\u200b To summarise the argument briefly presented here. What we can for short call the \"3-2-1\" definition of utopianism involves seeing the subject as possessing three faces or dimensions, utopian social theory, literary utopias and dystopias, and utopian practice; two functions, that of providing a space of psychological alterity, and that of permitting the futurological dream of ideal societies; and one content, defined by belongingness. Utopianism is a stand-alone ideology insofar as it adopts variants on the Morean paradigm, but all major systems of ideas have utopian or ideal components which are used as reference points to suggest the goals of their systems. All forms of utopianism aim in particular at providing circumstances in which belongingness can be fulfilled. This ideal can be understood as the resolution of the central problem of alienation in modern life, an issue crucial to Marxism but equally to many other strands of modern social theory. The chief task now before us in the 2020s, to determine how it can achieve practical form in the face of the looming environmental catastrophe of the present century, can be addressed at another time.

[8] This leaves aside the broader problem as to how far any ideal society rests on the labour or exploitation of some group(s), for whom the utopia of one group may thus become the dystopia of another. Decolonising utopia is an ongoing project. Some communes, like that founded by Josiah Warren in Ohio, have been called \"Utopia\". [9] See Martin Buber. Paths in Utopia , and Ernst Bloch. The Principle of Hope (3 vols, Basil Blackwell, 1986).

The argument here turns largely on two assumptions, firstly that \"human needs have no boundaries we could delineate; consequently, total satisfaction is incompatible with the variety and indefiniteness of human needs\" (p. 138), and secondly opposition to \"The utopian dogma stating that the evil in us has resulted from defective social institutions and will vanish with them is indeed not only puerile but dangerous; it amounts to the hope, just mentioned, for an institutionally guaranteed friendship\".'}]"

Click HERE to subscribe. (1625–1630) Videos by VICE The United States might be a very different place today if Thomas Morton, rather than the Puritans of Plymouth, had had his way. A cider-swilling good-time guy from Devon in the west of England, Morton threw the finest parties the 17th century had ever seen at Mount Wollaston on Massachusetts Bay. The partying had a higher, utopian purpose, though. Dreaming of a liberated land, Morton, a poet and lawyer, styled himself the “host” of Merrymount and his fellow colonists “consociates”—free men who were allowed (up to a point) to integrate with the local Algonquin. Morton erected a pagan maypole at Merrymount, arousing the fury of the Puritans, who arrested him and his fellow revelers, all of whom were too hammered to resist. After being sent back to England and put on trial, he was eventually cleared of all charges. Once he returned to America, his persecution, however, continued: More charges were brought against him, and his house and the houses of his supporters were burned down. America continued in the Puritan way, the egalitarian dream of Merrymount cast aside, the “merriment after the old English custom” (Morton’s words) feared as the devil’s indulgence. (1698–1700) Founded by 1,200 Scots on the Gulf of Darien in 1698, Caledonia was a shot at the big time that ended up bankrupting Scotland and costing her independence. Over two centuries before the Panama Canal was constructed, the financial guru William Paterson, the brains behind the colony, realized that establishing an overland route between the Atlantic and Pacific across the Isthmus of Panama would make whoever controlled it very rich. Stricken by famine and about to go broke, the Scottish people latched onto the dream of becoming a major trading nation through a colony in Equatorial America. The public funded the venture—some giving away their entire life’s savings—but the adventurers who set sail from the docks of Leith were ravaged by tropical diseases before the Spanish burned their colony to the ground. Feeling threatened, the English had prohibited their colonies from trading with Caledonia, thereby assisting in its downfall. The few survivors returned in disgrace, and England swooped in, bringing Scotland into the union with an offer of compensation for the vast numbers of Scots who’d lost their livelihoods supporting the dream of a Scottish America. (1625–1630) Videos by VICE On Christmas Day, 1858, Mary Ann Girling, a married mother of two from Suffolk in the east of England, claimed she was visited by Jesus Christ, who appeared before her in her bedroom in Ipswich. In 1864, she said she received her second vision. Life for the farmer’s daughter had been relatively unremarkable up till that point, but from then on she would claim to be a prophet and soon after founded a sect called the Children of God, which landed her on the front pages of local newspapers along with accusations of dabbling in witchcraft. Girling believed it was her mission to lead the Children of God to the Promised Land, which turned out to be the New Forest, in southern England. She turned up there, in the tiny village of Hordle, with more than a hundred dancing, shaking religious fanatics. Evicted from its utopia again and again, the sect dwindled over time and finally broke up in 1886, when Girling died of cancer. (1887–1893) Before Adolf Hitler, there was the schoolteacher Bernhard Förster. An anti-Semite inspired by the supremacist notion of the German Volk, which prized racial purity, he and his wife, Elisabeth, set off from the Fatherland to establish an Aryan paradise in the jungles of Paraguay. The local animals, insects, and microbes obviously hadn’t been listening to their Wagner, because they showed no respect for the racial superiority of the Germans, who they set about with glee. Förster poisoned himself in a hotel in 1889, and in 1893, Elisabeth returned home to Germany to look after her brother, Friedrich Nietzsche. Nueva Germania became part of Paraguay, and it was rumored that the Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele passed through it while on the run following the end of World War II. (1889) In a century defined by Europe’s ceaseless thirst for gold and slaves, psychopathic Cossack adventurer Nikolai Ashinov was both an exception and the rule. Fueled in part by hazy notions of a kinship between the Russian and Ethiopian Orthodox churches and the desire to actualize the mythological kingdom of Prester John (a Christian paradise that did not exist, though throughout the Middle Ages it was looked for—a classic bit of fake news, basically), Ashinov founded the Russian colony of New Moscow on the Red Sea coast of Africa, in what is today Djibouti. The whole enterprise lasted a few weeks. Ashinov, a binge drinker and rapist, refused to submit to the French, whose gunboats shelled New Moscow to the ground. Washing his hands of the whole affair, Russia’s tsar at the time, Alexander III, called it a “sad and stupid comedy.” (1893–1899) In the 1890s, Australia was beset by drought and depression. Sheep shearers were striking for better conditions and being brutally punished as a result. The socialist William Lane dreamed of better things and took off for Paraguay with 220 fellow Australians, where he founded New Australia on socialist principles. Having lost 90 percent of its male population in wars with Brazil and Uruguay, the Paraguayan government was keen to help the Aussies out. The single Australian men were even keener, fraternizing with the local ladies, something Lane, who seemed to want to keep New Australia Australian (i.e. white European), was not keen on. In a huff, he left New Australia, founded another settlement nearby (Cosme), and, after that didn’t work out, took off for New Zealand, where he resumed his career as a journalist and embraced pro-imperial conservatism. New Australia and Cosme were dissolved into Paraguay, bequeathing the world an intriguing new group of people, the Australian Paraguayans. (1901–1904) Finland has a long history of utopian thinking, sparked by some 18th-century brothers who founded a mystic-separatist sect and took it on a Northern European tour for 11 years. Since then, Finns have roamed the world, from Sierra Leone to Brazil, in search of a more idyllic life. Sointula (“Place of Harmony”), on Malcolm Island off Canada’s west coast, was one such place. Founded in 1901 by Matti Kurikka, a restless soul who had already failed to get a similar venture going in Queensland, Australia, Sointula was hobbled by the fact that none of its Finnish inhabitants were particularly good at fishing or being lumberjacks, which, in a place dominated by sea and forest, wasn’t that helpful. Kurikka also had some pretty radical ideas about sex and raising children. He believed the father of a child should be a man who had not lived with the mother and that people who lived with each other shouldn’t have sex. Despite this, it was a devastating fire that ended the early settlement. (1919) In September 1919, the Italian poet and World War I fighter pilot Gabriele D’Annunzio, with a collection of mutinous soldiers at his back, stormed the city of Fiume on the Adriatic Coast. The place had, since the war’s end, been contested territory. Nobody stopped the poet-warrior, and for the next 15 months, he served as the city’s charismatic dictator, delivering mystical speeches from his balcony every day before returning to a large, ever-changing group of lovers. A man who had his sons call him “Maestro” rather than “Papa,” D’Annunzio, who had a penchant for cocaine and lobsters, claimed to have had many thousands of lovers. He and his followers dressed in black uniforms decorated with skull and crossbones. A group claiming to represent the women of Fiume gave him a “holy” dagger, one biographer wrote, “so you may carve the word ‘victory’ in the living flesh of our enemies.” Long before they rose to any kind of prominence, Hitler and Mussolini were both disciples of the poet. But the practice of government was not for D’Annunzio, and chancers, thieves, and libertines overran Fiume before the government in Rome restored order and ended the proto-Fascist, Bacchanalian dream. (1927) Henry Ford didn’t just want to destroy public transport and cover the planet with his automobiles: He wanted to mold hearts and minds, and to have his own endless supply of sweet, sweet rubber. And so Fordlandia, a midwestern factory town in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, was founded. Rainforest was cleared, hundreds of miles of road was built, and Ford—who never visited the place—did his best to socially engineer the environment from afar, imposing diet regulations on his Brazilian workers, telling them not to drink, and even pushing them into taking up traditional European dances like polkas and the waltz. All of this led to riots, knife fights, and rebellion, with Ford compounding things by trying to apply large-scale industrial practices to the complex ecosystem of the rainforest. None of the latex from the Fordlandia trees was ever used in a Ford car, and the experiment ended in failure. (1965–1977) The first place to ever be called a “hippie commune,” Drop City, in the rural south of Colorado, was made up of dome-like structures inspired by the design principles of Buckminster Fuller. These structures were made of everything from car roofs to the caps of Sprite bottles. Founded on a seven-acre plot of land by filmmakers and art students, the community aimed at egalitarianism and was seen as being an active rejection of life under American capitalism and the deeply unpopular war in Vietnam. It was a profound dream, but once the word about Drop City got out, trouble came in: There was a murder, biker gangs arrived, and a cattle rancher later bought the utopia. The last of the domes was taken down in the late 1990s.'}, {'title': \"Why Has Utopia Failed? - Tomorrow's World\", 'url': 'https://www.tomorrowsworld.org/magazines/2006/november-december/why-has-utopia-failed', 'content': 'Will there ever be a time of peace on the earth? What will it mean to you? Would you like to live in a better world—a world filled with peace, equity, happiness and prosperity for every man, woman and child? Most of us would. But why does such a world seem so far out of reach? For thousands of years, philosophers have debated: What would a perfect world be like? How would it come about? Yet, in spite of all their ideas and efforts, human beings have not been able to create a perfect world. Why not? Has Utopia failed—or is it even possible? The term \"Utopia\" to describe a perfect world was first coined by Sir Thomas More, in 1518. More wrote a novel depicting a fantastic new society, free from problems. More set this seemingly perfect society on an island, and gave it the name \"Utopia.\" Since then, \"Utopia\" has become a kind of shorthand for a perfect place. But did you realize, utopia literally means \"no place\"? The Greek ou means \"no\" and topos means \"place.\" Even More knew that the place he wrote about was only imaginary. Indeed, there is \"no place\" on earth where human beings are all living together in real peace, with real harmony, experiencing lives free of worry, stress or pain. Rather, everywhere we look we see problems—poverty, crime, hunger, disease, war and corruption. Truly, Utopia does not exist on earth. But why not? Is it because we are not educated? Eighteenth century British philosophers Jeremy Bentham and James Mill believed that \"with universal education all serious social problems would be solved by the end of the century.\" But were all social problems solved by 1800? Of course not! Nineteenth century Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakunin rejected the idea of divine law. \"The first revolt is against the supreme tyranny of theology, of the phantom of God. As long as we have a master in heaven, we will be slaves on earth\" ( Pleasures of Philosophy, Will Durant, p. 279). Bakunin envisioned a world where education would make obsolete the need for God or state. \"Bakunin… predicted that education would spread so rapidly that by 1900 the state would be unnecessary, and men would obey only the laws of nature\" ( ibid. ). But he, like Bentham and Mill, was proved wrong. Neither did the 20th century bring Utopia. Indeed, the two most destructive wars in all of human history were fought in the first half of that century. In World War I, as many as one out of every seven adult males on earth was in uniform—more than 50 million men. Thirteen million died while fighting. And World War II was even more devastating. In World War I, just 5 percent of those killed were civilians, but in World War II, fully half of the casualties were civilian noncombatants. With 50 different countries involved in the conflict, World War II was truly a world war. The United States alone sent 16 million men to fight in that war, and around the world the estimated death toll is as high as 60 million. Truly, it was, \"the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history…\" (\"Second World War,\" Encyclopaedia Britannica, 15th ed.). Time has not brought us closer to Utopia. So, maybe we just need more time? Surely, if given enough time, humanity will figure it out, and find the way to make a perfect society, yes? That is what the Marquis de Condorcet, a French philosopher, thought in 1793 when he said, \"No bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; the perfectibility of man is absolutely indefinite; the progress of this perfection… has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us\" (Durant, p. 243). Is that what history teaches us? Or, if we look at the track record of mankind, should we expect that poverty, disease, corruption and war will become even more deadly, if we are left to our own devices? What Man\\'s Efforts Will Bring Bible prophecy foretells that there will be a coming war so devastating that World War I and World War II will pale by comparison. \"Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, \\'Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates\\'… Now the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred million, and I heard the number of them\" (Revelation 9:13–16). That army will swoop into the Middle East from the east, and its arrival will lead to a climactic battle for control of the whole earth. What will be the result? \"And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone. By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths\" (vv. 17–18). Scripture makes plain that this is where human beings, by themselves, will go—into chaos, destruction and death. Mankind does not know the way to peace, and its crowning achievement, at the end of our modern era, will be to very nearly wipe out every human being on earth. In fact, it is only through God\\'s grace and mercy that humanity will escape total annihilation. Notice what Jesus said about the end times: \"For the trouble at that time will be far more terrible than any there has ever been, from the beginning of the world to this very day. Nor will there ever be anything like it again. But God has already reduced the number of days; had he not done so, nobody would survive. For the sake of his chosen people, however, God will reduce the days\" (Matthew 24:21–22, Good News Translation ). Yes, to save us from the certainty of total cosmocide, Jesus Christ will return to earth, and intervene powerfully and decisively! What will it take to have Utopia on earth? What is the missing ingredient in our search for a new and better world? Notice what the Apostle John wrote about the condition of mankind at the end of this age: \"But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk; and they did not repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts\" (Revelation 9:20). John describes our sinful world, where billions routinely break the Ten Commandments, which God gave mankind to regulate society and teach us how to love each other—and how to love God. Yes, this is the missing ingredient: obedience to the laws of God. Billions today think they can achieve happiness by becoming free from law—especially from God\\'s law. But God says just the opposite. Ancient King David knew this, when he wrote these inspiring words in the Psalms: \"Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord!\" (Psalm 119:1). \"Make me walk in the path of Your commandments, for I delight in it\" (v. 35). \"Great peace have those who love Your law, and nothing causes them to stumble\" (v. 165). David knew the blessings of God\\'s law. He did not think that \"freedom\" meant the freedom to murder another person, or steal their possessions. Many today believe the false notion that law brings unhappiness, and that unrestrained liberty brings absolute joy. However, God reveals that His law brings true liberty—James even calls the Ten Commandments \"the law of liberty\" (James 1:25; 2:12). God\\'s law is also called the \"royal law.\" We read: \"If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, \\'You shall love your neighbor as yourself,\\' you do well\" (James 2:8). When James called God\\'s law the \"royal\" law, he meant the Ten Commandments. In case there might be any doubt, he names two of them: \"For He who said, \\'Do not commit adultery,\\' also said, \\'Do not murder.\\' Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law\" (v. 11). Christ had come to \"fulfill\" the law, not to destroy it (Matthew 5:17). Christ—as the very same God who had given the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai (for more on this topic, please write for our free reprint article, \"Who Was the God of the Old Testament?\")—showed His apostles and followers how to live the full spiritual application of that law, through His love. Many who call themselves Christians mistakenly think that Jesus, by emphasizing love, was doing away with God\\'s law. But what did the apostles think \"love\" meant? \"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments\" (1 John 5:1–2). Yes, as we love God, we will obey Him, which means to keep His commandments. Note also: \"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome\" (v. 3). God\\'s Law, or Man\\'s? Even this world\\'s philosophers usually admit that a perfect society will be ruled by law. The disagreement is over what the laws should be. The philosopher Bertrand Russell summed up what the Greek philosopher Plato considered an ideal society. Plato \"proceeds to apply his communism to the family. Friends, he says, should have all things in common, including women and children. He admits that this presents difficulties, but thinks them not insuperable… Marriage, as we know it, will be radically transformed… [\\'These women shall be, without exception, the common wives of these men, and no one shall have a wife of his own.\\']\" ( A History of Western Philosophy , p. 108). What about children? Here is what Plato envisioned: \"All children will be taken away from their parents at birth, and great care will be taken so that no parents shall know who are their children, and no children shall know who are their parents… Since no one knows who his parents are, he is to call everyone \\'father\\' whose age is such that he might be his father, and similarly as regards \\'mother\\' and \\'brother\\' and \\'sister\\'… Mothers are to be between twenty and forty, fathers between twenty-five and fifty-five. Outside these ages, intercourse is to be free, but… abortion or infanticide is to be compulsory\" ( ibid .) That is what Plato thought would be the ultimate happy, peaceful society. Does that sound to you like an ideal world? Would it build stable and healthy relationships? Would it build trust, friendship and fulfillment? Would it build close and loving families? Of course not! Yet, sadly, modern society has in some ways moved closer to Plato\\'s ideal than to God\\'s. Traditional marriage is under assault, by some who believe it is unnecessary, and by others who want to redefine it in an unprecedented way. Millions of children, born out of wedlock, do not know their fathers. Why does this approach inevitably fail? God gave the very simple answer with His law: \"You shall not commit adultery\" (Exodus 20:14). God designed society; He knows that family is the building block of society, and that when you destroy it, you destroy society. God instructed us: \"Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you\" (Exodus 20:12). A society in which children fail to honor their parents will quickly fall apart. And a society where parents may legally murder their unborn children is far from a Utopia. Have the 43 million children aborted in the United States since 1973 experienced Utopia? Indeed, modern Western society is moving closer and closer to Plato\\'s \"ideal\"—but what has that move brought us? More fulfillment? More joy? Or has it brought regret, pain and heartache? Even in the realm of politics, we are moving closer to what Plato envisioned. Read what he taught about the importance of lying: \"Lying, Plato says explicitly, is to be a prerogative of the government.… There is to be \\'one royal lie,\\' which, Plato hopes, may deceive the rulers, but will at any rate deceive the rest of the city. This \\'lie\\' is set forth in considerable detail… The most important part of it is the dogma that God has created men of three kinds, the best made of gold, the second best of silver, and the common herd of brass and iron. Those made of gold are fit to be guardians; those made of silver should be soldiers; the others should do the manual work… It is thought hardly possible to make the present generation believe this myth, but the next, and all subsequent generations can be so educated as not to doubt it\" (Russell, p. 108). Plato taught that it was the government\\'s right—even its responsibility—to lie to its citizens. How does that sound today, in our world where many governments have been caught lying to their citizens? Have those lies brought about Utopia? Lying is a plague in modern society. One estimate suggests that 91 percent of Americans lie regularly—and that they most often lie to those closest to them ( The Day America Told the Truth , p. 45). When you find out that someone has lied to you, how does it make you feel? Does it bring you closer, or do you feel hurt, betrayed and let down? God does not deceive, and He commanded His people not to practice the way of deception. The Ninth Commandment plainly instructs: \"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor\" (Exodus 20:16). Utopia for You? In your own life, have you fallen victim to the myth that God\\'s law is harsh, unkind and restrictive? Or are you willing to test His law to see if it works as He says it does? When Jesus Christ returns to earth, as King of kings and Lord of lords, He will teach—and exemplify—God\\'s law. But Christians today can experience the blessings and benefits of that law, right now, by putting it into practice in their own lives. What will the world be like when Christ rules it through His law? We read: \"Now it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the Lord\\'s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it. Many people shall come and say, \\'Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; He will teach us His ways, and we shall walk in His paths.\\' For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\" (Isaiah 2:2–3). This is not a fantasy or an allegory. Jerusalem will be the seat of God\\'s Kingdom, from which Jesus Christ will rule the earth, based on the solid foundation of His law. Then, the world will experience unprecedented peace. Wars will cease: \"He [God] shall judge between the nations, and shall rebuke many people; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore\" (Isaiah 2:4). Truly, the earth will then be at peace: \"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall play by the cobra\\'s hole, and the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper\\'s den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain\" (Isaiah 11:6–9). That world is coming. It is not just a dream. Human beings, who have for thousands of years sought to build Utopia on their own, will find under God\\'s rule the peace and prosperity they have never achieved by themselves. Why will this finally be possible? Because \"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea\" (Isaiah 11:9). We all await that day. But each of us can begin living that life right now, and experiencing today the blessings that the rest of humanity will finally taste in Tomorrow\\'s World.'}, {'title': 'Why Utopian Communities Fail - UNTOPIA', 'url': 'https://ewanmorrison.substack.com/p/why-utopian-communities-fail', 'content': 'Once again we see a resurgence of interest in intentional communities and in Utopian experiments in living communally. Even Time Magazine is advocating such ways of living as a solution to the problems of modern living. Over the last ten years I have made forays into alternative living; finding and testing out Utopian intentional communities. My intention was originally to escape from the dog-eat-dog world of capitalism and join one such community. However the results of these life experiments threw up a body of evidence that, I feel, disproves the viability of such forms of living. The following are observations from residential visits to the Findhorn Foundation, Scotland, an ecological communal farming community on the border between Scotland and England, and an anarchist commune in Wales, with further observations on Auroville, India, Esalen, California and the history of Utopian attempts since the middle ages. Intended as evidence of what can go wrong within communal living experiments, these points may also shed some light on why hundreds of such communities since the 19th century did not survive beyond one generation and frequently collapsed after only a few years. It is hoped that lessons can be learned from honestly admitting to these failures. Both Findhorn and Auroville were established as separatist Utopias, retreats from the western world, created in the 1960s. Bound together by loose aggregations of diverse belief systems these were intentional communities — communities forged not by history, culture or clan but by the intention to be self-sustaining Internationalist Utopian communities. While many such ventures failed (478 intentional communities since the 1820s have now shrunk to 112 worldwide in the last 30 years) these are now two of the largest spiritual centers in the world. They have large residential communities of around 200 each, while at the same time supporting themselves by running courses for numbers of visitors (Findhorn has 1,200 paying guest per year and Auroville over 50,000 visitors.) Both communities originated from the mixed bag of ideals within the hippie era, but have now developed ways to survive within capitalism. Both have moved away from self-subsistence as a means of economic survival towards what could be termed Spiritual Tourism or Spiritual Education . On their own terms, they are thriving, however, viewed through the prism of their own claims about themselves and their founding beliefs, they have problems. And not only that, they have problems in common, which are shared with other intentional communities and this is evidence that these kinds of issues are systemic and intrinsic and maybe even foundational to intentional communities. The following are things I have diagnosed from first-hand observation that go wrong when we try to turn Utopia into a real location. As my ventures involved other intentional communities as well, rather than explain all of their contexts, and to protect anonymity, I refer throughout to several of the communities as “Community X.” A group at Auroville, holding hands after the dawn Fire. Matriwords. CC. “If everyone was to behave like us then the world would be a better place — we would be able to get rid of guilt, inequality, competition, greed and anger.” “If we all ate less and were less materialistic the world would be a better place.” “Only by changing ourselves can we change the world, by our living example.” This is the one foundational belief system of every intentional community that all members can agree on. This was also the justification that the hippies used for practically everything. The theory goes like this: Instead of acting in the world, all you have to do is become a peaceful, non-violent person — a model human, and others will follow your model. This is how you change the world, by focusing entirely upon yourself. The results of this experiment are, generations later, clear — changing yourself became a vast industry of self-help books and courses, dietary, fitness and personal “spiritual” planning regimes — a form of obsessive self-focusing and self-policing, which, it turns out, corporations are very happy to encourage. Ironically, intentional communities also make a lot of money from self-discovery courses. A seven day residential workshop at Esalen, will set you back between $1850 and $7000. Five days of “Vital Moves\\xadHeartbeat” workshop at Findhorn, and the “being in community” workshop were both more modestly priced in the range of £490\\xad–£780. And of course, the true self is ever illusive and ever flawed, so there’s so much self-perfecting to do that no one ever actually gets back to the question of the fixing the world. The many divergent and different countries of the world are not going to adopt the standards of intentional communities so this whole idea of being self-perfecting model humans is myopic and even narcissistic. It is also a way of thinking only in terms of intentions and not of consequences. You may declare outstanding universalist intentions for world peace, but what are the actual consequences of twenty people in the western world deciding to go on a fast in protest against GM crops? Zero. What are the consequences for the Global economy of 1000 people in the west dropping out of the consumption cycle and growing their own vegetables? Zero. You can do this as a way to make yourself feel better about your consumption choices, but if you use “changing the world” as a justification, then you are deluding yourself. “If everyone did it the world would be a better place.” This is also patronizing because it sets up the self as an example for all. And this narcissism is self-reinforcing as the failure of the rest of the world to adopt all your choices and opinions, become just more evidence of how ethically superior you are. Those who use organic food as a metaphor for self-perfection fail to grasp that not everyone in the world can afford to eat or grow organic vegetables and to drop out of capitalism: it is technically impossible to feed the entire population of the planet with organic produce. Ergo — perfecting yourself is a minority pursuit which would actually have damaging repercussions if adopted by society at large. The idea that intentional communities will only permit the entry of certain kinds of people has a long history and may have its roots in monotheistic religions which have a Heaven for those without sin, or further back within the Greek idea of Elysium, home of the Demi-Gods and heroes (regular mortals excluded). If you want to create a better society from scratch then you have to keep the bad people out, so in Plato’s Republic (94BC), Lawyers are banned by punishment of death, and “tragic poets” (artists and writers who excite the irrational emotions) are banished beyond the city walls, while Plato insists that the “deformed offspring of both the superior and inferior” be put away in some “mysterious unknown places.” In the Utopia of The Diggers (1649), a group of early communist agrarian Utopians, Gerard Winstanley’s Law of Freedom shares Plato’s hatred and states that “anyone who administers the law for money or reward, and anyone who buys or sells anything, will be executed.” Then there is the banishing of all money lenders in Utopias from Thomas More (147–1535) — in his Utopia gold is used only for piss pots, to remind the populace of its worthlessness. In Thomas More’s book, there are no soldiers; when the Utopians need to fight wars they hire mercenaries from nearby warlike nations and as such More’s Utopians are just as keen to find wicked men to exploit as good men to employ. They are most happy when the mercenaries they hire die in combat, as they want to eventually “ wipe the fifth off the face of the earth completely .” In real attempts at feminist lesbian separatism, in communal living experiments such as Kate Millet’s Art colony (1961–) and the Furies Collective (1971– ) all men were banned. While the fictional Utopia of the devout Catholic first president of Sinn Fein, Edward Joseph Martin (1859–1923) is an island with no women, in which Greek is spoken and all men are artists and aesthetes and the “ignorant feminized masses” are banished. In the Utopia of social revolutionary Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639), it is a capital offence for women to wear cosmetics or high heels, or a particular kind of gown that Campanella found to be sexually provocative — in a move very much like that expounded by Islam where all difference between women are eradicated by the use of the Burka, so as to avoid hostile competition between males. While in the Solarian City, sodomites are punished with death, social engineering also takes place: and “fat girls are matched with thin men and thin girls with fat ones, so as to avoid extremes in their offspring.” This kind of eugenic manipulation foreshadows the Nazi Utopia, and the eradication of Jews and homosexuals with the goal of purifying the Aryan race. H.G Wells (1866-1946) in his New Republic advocated phasing out the “vicious helpless and pauper masses” (also described as “People of the Abyss”) plus criminals, the insane, drunks, addicts and the physically unfit through sterilization or poisoning — “the men of the New Republic will not be squeamish, in facing or inflicting death, because they will have a fuller sense of the possibilities of life than we possess.” It is a shocking fact but almost half of all imagined Utopias involve some degree of eugenics and/or social engineering plus the abortion or destruction of undesirables. In the dystopias (inverted utopias) of Orwell and Huxley, only those who have had their brains altered to come in line with the dominant order are allowed to remain alive, whether this is through a pacifying pleasure drug ( Huxley’s Soma ) or through torture and brainwashing in 1984. The Thought Police and doublethink of Orwell is just the negative face of what in the history of Utopianism is seen as a positive force. The logic goes that the only way to really make a Utopia work is to change the minds; to as the hippies said “Free your mind and your ass will follow.” Huxley also wrote a hugely influential Utopian text — The Island (1962), which mixed Buddhism, behaviorism and mind-altering drugs on a fictional Utopian island called Pala, in which behavioral conditioning made it impossible for “rabble rousers” and “heroic leaders” to arise. The overriding idea is that if Utopia is attempted without the very best and most ethical of the species (without behavioral engineering, mind alteration and eugenics), then new members will carry in contamination from the old world and destroy the Utopia. Rather than attempt to modify the behavior of the population of the world, modern intentional communities chose instead to screen out bad people, and to work on changing the minds of those who are “open to transformation.” Entry is usually by referral from an existing member, or through interview by elders. While Esalen is accessible “by reservation only,” Intentional Community X has a perimeter fence and people who acts as ad hoc security guards to stop strangers entering. Intentional communities — these havens of universal openness and egalitarianism — are actually extremely exclusive. In trying to exorcise the demons of the outside world, to detox from western culture, individuals in intentional communities become focused on the body. The body can be managed, punished and changed whereas the outside world cannot. This is literalized by those who engage in activities like “Fasting for Peace.” Taking joy in food is also looked down upon, as food is fuel for the body and the body is the vehicle of the soul. Such body punishment in the name of spiritual purity is positively medieval and has its roots in the Christian idea of Anorexia Mirabilis (miraculous lack of appetite) and Inedia Prodigiosa (Prodigious fasting) and to this day modern intentional communities harbor and nurture people who hold the belief that the body should be sustained not with food but with “universal energy.” In intentional communities food is generally seen as mere fuel, and pleasure in food is seen as un-spiritual. Food is usually prepared collectively with people with little or no experience of cooking taking turns on rota. The resulting food is bland, tasteless, overcooked, recycled and reheated, and attempts to improve the quality and taste are frowned upon and seen as being “materialistic” and “hedonistic.” The food is basically a form of penance — the bare minimum of nutrition with the least taste — after all, if one taste is too strong some people may object and feeding 100 people means that 100 people might differ on what they like — so food has to be re-boiled to rudimentary blandness. In Findhorn, ironically, vast amounts of vegan mayonnaise and ketchup are used to fill in for the lack of flavor. This creates feelings of guilt. People talk more than in any other community about how much they miss their decadent old treats — chocolate biscuits, meat, potato chips, sauces etc — and they pride themselves on how well they are resisting the urge for such temptations. They talk about how much they have come to like “simple food” in the hope that they can convince themselves and others that they are being “pure” and “good.” Food-pleasure-denial becomes a metaphor for self-purification. Like medieval doctors discussing the consistency of excrement, looking for signs of spiritual improvement, such conversations are not uncommon in intentional communities. Since hierarchies supposedly “do not exist” and status symbols are denied, they re-surface in sublimated ways. Diet becomes a signifier of moral superiority. Thus macrobiotic vegans are at the top of the pecking order, with vegetarians in the middle and carnivores are very often not even permitted entry to the community. As intentional communities are some of the only harbors left for people who are essentially craving the same experiences that led people in past eras to severe asceticism, to vows of silence, to the abandonment of all property, the punishment of the mortal body or to becoming anchorites, people who are drawn to such experiences are revered and protected within intentional communities. One of the problems of this is that the proximity to those who are involved in self-punishment-unto-death leads the other members of the community to revere these people too highly and to feel guilty that they too are not making enough sacrifices — that they are too tied to bodily pleasures and modern inventions. Thus, in Community X, there have been those who have rejected modern medicine, and who have become severely ill as a result. Also, diets geared towards austerity and partaking of the minimum for daily sustenance are not good for growing children, and having an entire community living on very low energy, a state of exhaustion is not good for morale or for communication, either with each other or with outsiders. When self-imposed suffering and refusal of al pleasures becomes the goal of a community, it accidentally triggers conflict within its ranks. Those who are suffering from lack of sustenance, are want to accuse others of hiding forbidden foods, partaking of forbidden pleasures. Forms of envy and craving are twisted into an ever more austere puritanism, and witch hunts of those who are not behaving and consuming austerely enough begin. This race to the bottom towards the way of life of the most austere, can begin simply, with say a vegetarian community bending towards the dietary needs of vegans for all communal meals, out of respect for the higher austerity-factor of the vegan diet. Then, those who are involved with the more ecological practice of macrobiotic eating, can complain that the vegan diet is dependent upon expensive imports, (which create carbon emissions in shipping, etc) so then the community attempts to be both Vegan and Macrobiotic — eating only that which can be grown within the community. This is the danger when austerity is elevated above natural bodily needs and a community can quickly amplify austerity into a competition, in which those who eat least and eat the most austere food are seen as having more spiritual currency. In 1999, a long-standing member of the Findhorn Foundation who followed the “Breathenarianst” belief — took this process of body-denial to its zenith, believing that a body could live on light and air alone. She was found dead in the mountains of the remote Scottish Highlands. Projects get abandoned in intentional communities. Because no one can admit they have failed, because ‘there is no such thing as failure’ and it is not a culture that is into “blame,” “risk” or entrepreneurial competition, people avoid taking any risks or addressing the consequences of failure. As individual inner motivation and goal orientation are frowned upon, projects lose energy very quickly and are often even sabotaged by others. So in intentional communities it is not uncommon to come across broken machinery, overgrown un-weeded herb gardens that only a year ago were part of an “aromatherapy’ project.” An overgrown mosaic path that was left incomplete and that leads nowhere. Rooms packed full of junk with a hand-drawn sign on the window that reads: Pottery workshop. These places become cluttered with half-completed art projects and abandoned attempts at making extra money through crafts or home produce. In Community X for example, I witnessed an abandoned attempt at digging a well, an abandoned reservoir, a broken polytunnel, an abandoned tractor and an abandoned plan to rebuild stone houses, to enable the inhabitants to move out of caravan living into more stable housing. Inhabitants don’t blame themselves, “things just happen,” or “projects lose steam” as if some malignant deity broke the tractor or punctured the polytunnel. Everything lingers in a non-judgemental state of entropy and sinks into decay, while nature, time and the outside world gallop onwards. As H.G. Wells noted in an essay he wrote after meeting Stalin — “All Utopias are static.” (His interview with Stalin can also be found here .) He meant this critically, in the sense that all Utopias are burdened by the need to stick to one single plan without divergence and that this leads to stagnation. The economic and existential stagnation that is seen everywhere in communist countries, and that leads to their demise, is apparent on a micro scale in intentional communities. Failure comes from failure to admit failure. Instead people hide from admitting failures, they don’t report them, they don’t learn and try again, they simply avoid places and activities as if they are cursed, and they endeavour to not blame themselves and to “keep on believing.” And in that great doing of nothing, the processes of entropy accelerate. There is one other great de-motivator: Although they may not like to admit it to themselves or to others, people in intentional communities also smoke a lot of weed. It feeds the “chill out, don’t be so goal orientated and judgemental” ethos and helps people to forget about failures. “Fristaden Christiania,” the autonomous anarchist intentional community in Copenhagen established in 1971 (with 850 residents), became an example of how a separatist community can become almost entirely focused on escape-enabling-drugs and stuck in hash-stasis. Lying and “mistake denial” are endemic within intentional communities and this feeds failure. Fear of failure of the community’s well intentioned projects leads to falsification of results and to propaganda (“We had a great year for turnips,” “the therapeutic singing session cured Samantha’s Asthma,” “The organic cabbages are the best ever”) — this is not dissimilar to the falsified quota announcements of more extreme Utopians who had control of entire nations — Mao and Stalin. Intentional communities bury their mistakes in the attempt to remain “positive” rather than learn from them. An ironic outcome as these places were set up as “experimental communities.” The result of these experiments, however, are never collated, and if they are they are denied. If things go wrong it can’t be because of the original plan, but because “people haven’t tried hard enough.” So residents work harder at a failing project, which may be structurally flawed from the start. Anyone who insists “there’s no point in even doing this, we tried it for the last four years and it failed every time” is just accused of being negative. So it is that mistakes are repeated indefinitely and put down to “people not believing enough.” Sure enough these projects — like the experiment in insulating houses with bails of hay , that then turn to mold because no-one factored in the damp climate of the North of Scotland — become abandoned and the God of “things just happen” is blamed. The sheer number of eco-projects that fail reveals that there is a causal connection between overblown Utopian intentionality, mistake denial and failure. When people tell themselves lies about the actual results of their plans, then bad planning and disappointing outcomes continue and continue to get worse. Potatoes have run out, three months too early but rather than admit defeat or place an order for a delivery from Asda, people go hungry then tell themselves it’s actually a good thing, it will be good for their spiritual learning and personal improvement. They also will make no attempt to rectify the miscalculation that led to the lack of food, so the next year the same mistake is repeated again and no back up plans made. In intentional communities, there are outbreaks of hunger, diarrhoea and food poisoning, and rather than blame the root causes, the negatives are transformed miraculously into positives. Rather say “the food you served was rotten” or “someone must have not cleaned the organic fertiliser off the carrots before cooking them as we all now have bacterial infections from ingesting animal excrement,” people will say, “I needed a detox and anyway.” The existence of power structures within intentional communities is nearly always denied. “There is no power hierarchy here,” “everyone is equal” are the mantras. Mention of power is seen as an oppressive remnant of the outside world, capitalistic brainwashing, etc. On the one hand, there is an absolute refusal of structure, and this can lead to “the tyranny of structurelessness,” in which voting takes place not by majority rule but an outcome reached only when everyone is in agreement. This “ consensus voting ,” could be re-named as coercive voting, as many find the process of “no outcome till everyone is unanimously behind the proposal” to be more like gang bullying. Under this system, nothing gets decided until “everyone agrees” and “everyone is happy.” This process is thoroughly anti-democratic. People who vote against a motion are slowly coerced and bullied until they fall into line. Problem-solving through consensus-only voting is also extremely slow. Those who continue to disagree with the majority are eventually forced out so that consensus is reached. This also makes it impossible to remove leaders, who, since they have been there since the start, have never been elected. Dissenters cannot even begin to mount an opposition. All criticism of leaders is banned, all suggestions for improvement in daily operations are seen as “attacks” on the leadership. Obsession with “contamination” from the outside world, leads to ritual obsessive cleansings. The experience of even the most anarchist of communities is that, over time, hierarchies do form . Such power structures cannot be got rid of by wishing them away or banishing the words “power” or “leader.” When communities that deny the need for leaders actually realize that they need leaders their existence becomes a source of shame and cognitive dissonance. When this happens censorship of language occurs and no-one can question those who actually hold power. This has been a problem in Community X in which unelected leaders or “elders” rule. These elders live in large heated stone houses on the property and there is a hierarchy that descends down through communal wooden houses to communal caravans. As these leaders are not elected they cannot be unelected. The class hierarchy that has developed in a place that insists that everyone is equal can only be explained by investing the elders with higher spiritual stature. As if by symbolic resonance, the issue where this question of power becomes most apparent is that of electrical power. In Community X — there are between 80-100 residents at the bottom of the (denied)) hierarchy who run up immense heating bills through attempting to heat caravans through the long hard winters. They have been on “waiting lists” for proper housing for years and are forced to live in un-insulated caravans and heat themselves with electric fires in temperatures that go below minus thirteen (celsius) . In a place which touts itself as an eco-community, such old un-insulated temporary caravans (that have become full-time homes) burn up much more carbon than a regular house and fail the insulation and safety standards guidelines set by the EU. Caravan dwellers have then to turn to cheaper gas heating which places them in serious danger from carbon monoxide emissions. Communalists like this, who can’t pay their heating bills have their electricity cut off – literalizing the claim that “there is no power here.” Many people come to intentional communities to escape from either their own “old self” or from what they see as a dangerous culture of “Western” individualism. The snuffing out of individuality leads however to the persecution of individualists within the community and to a ritualized “Group Think” mentality which is more closed than even that of a small village. The anti-individualism also magnifies the status of leaders. This was clear in Findhorn, with the leadership of Eileen Caddy, who was treated like a demi-god with quasi-supernatural powers. Snuffing out individualism and permitting only positive-group-speak results in only conversations and actions which cause no offense to anyone and which only everyone will understand. Dumbed down, petty, small talk about the daily activities is commonplace, as is covert bitching and banal repetitions of positive expressions, mantras, quotations learned by rote, etc. This has been reported as a problem among communitarians since the 1860s. In any community where equality is enforced, people with talents and unique qualities tend to be shamed into acting with less ambition and into suppressing their talents. This “leveling” was something Nietzsche warned us about . If you are good at singing, or writing or gardening, you will make others who do not share your talents feel inferior, so in the interests of equality and peaceful co-habitation you must be less good at what you do and pretend not to be passionate about it. The result is a race to the bottom in mediocrity in which the people who are good at nothing enjoy watching all the talented people sink down to their level. People with artistic talents are particularly targeted. As a result of the envy and resentment that creative people create, these people are told they must run workshops and share their art skills. They must accept and preach that “everyone is an artist” and rather than focusing on their own art they must do group projects with collectivist themes and imagery. In this way the real threat caused by the artistically talented is defused and suppressed and mediocrity reigns. Witness the communally painted rainbow murals and hand-print group paintings that are found within intentional communities. As displays of individuality are frowned upon, the iconography of paintings, sculptures and music tend to avoid experiment and innovation and so cluster around repetitive clichés — the dove, the rainbow, the sunset, the wheel or mandala, happy children playing in the sun. It is no coincidence that these same symbols have been used by communist dictatorships and religious cults, like the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Kitsch is more than merely mediocre or lazy art, it is the deliberate stamping out of all individual self-expression. The intentional communities here hold to a belief in “positive talk”, removing all negatives from oneself and ones communication with others. You are taught to train yourself to “Have only positive thoughts.” As Aristotle demonstrated comedy depends upon negatives just as narrative and indeed learning depends upon conflict and weighing of two sides found in Socratic method. Jokes usually are based on confessions of inadequacy and personal failings, on prejudices and unfortunate moments in life, embarrassments and so on. However, all such negativity is outlawed and as a result humor vanishes from the intentional community. Many multi-faith organizations actually frown upon humor and laughter. They say, “when you are spiritually developed you will no longer have the need to laugh.” Without the ability to make jokes about personal failings, there is no release from the project of self-perfection, and so a vicious circle develops: increasing concern over ones perfection and how others see you, in turn destroys the possibility of laughing at oneself, which in turn makes the self-more paranoid about failing. Eventually humor becomes feared. It is stigmatized as a personal failing. It is seen as being cruel. “We should just be nice to each other and ourselves and not laugh at anybody.” This condition shares similarities with the positive reinforcement and politically correct movements, both of which have attempted to outlaw humor and enforce linguistic conformity. Again this is the subjugation of daily reality to the demands of an abstract ideal not actually grounded in real human behavior but in an impossible abstract ideal. Funny people become frowned on in intentional communities and those who believe in communally policed-language gain power. Many naturally humorless people find refuge in communes and enforce their condition on others as a universal credo. Once they get rid of the funny people and the people who ask questions they can rule with humorless, joyless intensity. One result of this is that intentional communities are lonely places. Focus on a rigidly defined language and self-purification lead to isolation of each individual from every other. Group hugs replace one-to-one intimacy and “partner exclusivity,” which are seen as needy vestiges of the old order. Derived from eastern religions, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism, strong partner bonds are seen as weakness and dependence. Tree hugging however, spread eagling yourself on the ground and kissing the earth, getting naked and being re-birthed through a naked human tunnel are common displacement activities and go some way to making up for actual one-to-one relationships. During many such exercises people often regress to states of early childhood need, crying for mothers that didn’t give them enough physical affection. Outbursts of tears that are then greeted by a pile-on of communal hugs and become a perverse behavior. Everyone wants to have a hug because they are denied intimacy so they prey on the person who is upset. This writer has on more than one occasion seen a crying person feel smothered by the communal hug and yell, “Get off me, Please! I just need to be alone.” What they are really craving is a one-to-one emotional, physical bond, not the artificial and heavily enforced “love everyone equally” ethos, that in effect deprives everyone of intimacy. Back breaking labor, which could be replaced with technology, becomes valorized — and technology demonized, causing unnecessary energy waste and a cult of s/he-who-works-hardest, even though much of the work is pointless. This is regression to feudal living, a fetishization of rustic poverty, back breaking toil and community labor. In California in the 1970s and 80s Gurdjieff and Vedanta inspired sects encouraged crushing rocks as a method of “destroying the western ego.” In certain unscrupulous cases cult leaders used such armies of unquestioning hard laborers as free manual labour. Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (otherwise known as Osho) and his now collapsed intentional community Rajneeshpuram in Oregon, exploited his followers in such a way and got them to build his properties for free, he also made them abandon their worldly possessions by donating them to his organization while he himself road around in a fleet of Rolls Royces. Without the displays of wealth, to a lesser degree this has also been the case in Findhorn and Auroville in which much labor was given “for free” or paid in an internal currency that could not be exchanged for “real money.” Agricultural efficiency is therefore not a priority in intentional communities and sometimes comes in conflict with the need for self-purification. As one Findhornian noted “There are two ways to cut a carrot — one is as part of your slow spiritual quest, the other is the urgent need to feed 200 people.” The first takes ten minutes per carrot, the second requires 500 to be cut in half an hour. In the 1990s there was a conflict in Findhorn over an automatic potato peeling machine, which drastically reduced labor and increased efficiency — as several hundred potatoes were required to be prepared every day. There was opposition however, as it was felt that the machine violated the sanctity of the process of food preparation by making things “too easy.” To this day, people use the machine sparingly and guiltily, and often recount this story of the conflict they had in accepting the need for it to exist at all. It is a well documented fact of psychology that cutting yourself off from the world leads to persecution complex. The focus on one leader who will protect all followers against impending threat from the outside world leads followers to extreme acts to demonstrate allegiance and faith and to protect the leader. The peaceful commune of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (Osho) was broken up in 1985 after they were caught planning to assassinate a district attorney. Even in peaceful places like the intentional communities I visited, there is a palpable fear of contaminated outsiders entering and destroying the colony. A siege mentality ensues and grows, especially whenever anything goes wrong within the community. External forces are blamed. The plants are not growing because they used water from “the system” rather than rain water; the water well they dug didn’t work because they are sure some local farmer has been interfering with the water table. The community becomes so used to scapegoating the outside world for all its own failings that it becomes a walled community either literally or metaphorically. The fear of invasion or subversion from the outside world grows the more the paranoia is invested in. The community is convinced that it is always just about to be attacked. This becomes part of the community cohesion. The community increasingly comes to resemble a separate island and one constantly on the look out for infiltrators or traitors. It is perhaps no coincidence that early formulations of Utopia were without exception images of islands in uncharted places. Any movement to outside and the world beyond, even if it be a trip to the supermarket as supplies of soy milk have run out is viewed with suspicion. It is not uncommon among peaceful intentional communities for there to be violent expulsions of people suspected of betraying community standards. These expulsions do not occur with judge and jury but with those in the invisible and denied hierarchy acting like overlords. Transgressors become punished in ways that are not in line with external societal law. One might even say that separatist groups can only survive with the threat of constant expulsions and that this goes back to the origins of communalism. Over time all such communities develop tightly policed group-think and become cults. It is worth bearing in mind, that Jonestown, the colony in Guyana created by The Rev Jim Jones managed to foster an obsessive groupthink of impending persecution. As a communist slash religious cult it saw itself as under imminent threat of destruction from the FBI and American capitalism. The 909 members who committed suicide , through the now infamous ingestion of cyanide in Kool Aid, did so because of a fear of an invasion from the outside world that did not actually exist. Jim Jones final speech, as his followers are dying around him, is evidence of how cult leaders actually depend upon creating a fear of external invasion to hold onto their power. Evidence also of the fatal dangers of believing that your intentional community is ethically pure precisely because it is under threat of imminent destruction. Long before Skinner and behavioral science there have been numerous attempts made to wipe the slate clean and re-program human behavior, enforcing new behavior models for Utopian dwellers. A simple example is the Hutterites, Shakers, Quakers and Amish, who have all laid down, to varying degrees, laws for behavior enforced by uniformity of dress and scheduling, and through limiting access to new technologies and “the modern world.” Although mostly religious in origin, within the 18th and 19th centuries over 190 intentional communities sprang up within the United States, all aiming to reshape human behavior; these experiments in living later influenced behavioral scientists. Etienne Cabet (1788–1856) a lawyer from Dijon, who later played an important part in the French Revolution, established a Utopian community in Illinois, with sixty-nine settlers, based on his best-selling fictional account of a planned Utopian colony — Travels in Icaria (1839). “Internal bickering” broke up the real colony but other Icarian communes replaced it, the last of them surviving until 1898 . The Icarians had a regimented workday that began at six a.m and involved communal meals, in which everyone received the same portions; nothing was owned privately, not even homes, and this leveling was believed to eliminate both poverty and hierarchy with one blow. Everyone wore the same clothes so that “there is no room for envy or coquettishness,” A rigorous form of behavioral modification based on clothing dominated with the intention of eliminating vanity, exhibitionism and competition “Childhood and youth, adolescence and maturity, the condition of celibacy or marriage, or widowhood or remarriage, the various professions and functions are all indicated by the clothes.” “The shape of each garment has been fixed in such a manner that it can be manufactured in the most easy, rapid way possible.” Within this Utopian experiment censorship was fully exercised , with all “Harmful books” being burned while “The republic should permit only certain persons to publish a work, just as it permits only pharmacists to prepare drugs.” Within Thomas More’s Utopia , individual houses are not allowed to accumulate wealth and the houses themselves are exchanged by lot every ten years to ensure that the idea of ownership is not allowed to develop. “Wandering idly” without permission is punished and travel is restricted through internal passports (a law he took from the Spartan law-giver Lycurgus — to discourage wanderers who spread rumors and disease) while the life of the poor and ignorant peasant is to be eradicated, with peasants being displaced to the cities and land being given over instead to sheep farming. Health care is free and provided by the state and gambling is forbidden. Clothing is regulated as Utopians do not “excel others by superfluous display of possessions.” or “pay honors to the rich”; the generic clothing comprises a leather working costume with a woolen cloak. Criminals wear fetters made of the most debased metal of all — gold. Such constant behavioral manipulation, More believed, tackled the root of the vices and creates better people. More felt such control was necessary to stomp out man’s natural tendencies towards laziness and conflict and it was motivated by “pity for the undeserved misery of the exploited poor.” The ultimate proposed solution was “a common life and subsistence…without any exchange of money.” Furthermore in his Utopia there would be: “Nowhere any pretext to evade work, no winehouse, no alehouse, no brothel anywhere, no opportunity for corruption, no lurking hole, no secret meeting place.” The result being a state of communal enforced “decency.” The joys of such enforced equal-ness and surveillance might seem oppressive to us today, but nonetheless More’s Utopia and the Icarian experiment went on to influence the young Karl Marx, and we can see traces of it within the history of the left. In imagined Utopias behavioral modification of a weak and easily tempted populace (who might regress to their old ways) has been a recurring obsession. In Johann Eberlien von Gunzburgs Utopia known as Wolfaria (1521), the persistent problems of idleness, drunkenness and licentiousness are to be cured by the drowning of drunks and punishing adultery by public execution (a tradition practiced by the Scots until 1697). In Campanella’s (1568—1639) planned City of the Sun , equality between men and women is enforced, again, by the wearing of unisex military clothes. Games that are played sitting down (chess, cards, dice) are banned, as a sedentary life leads to early death. While all seven walls of the city are adorned with murals illustrating the sciences of astronomy, geology, anthropology, zoology, botany and anatomy (with pickled specimens on display where appropriate) so that all the streets are classrooms and children learn as a by-product of play. All punishments are public and there is no jail. Those who commit sodomy are forced to wear a shoe on their heads and a sign that says they have perverted the natural order — putting the feet where the head should be and if they repeat the crime they are stoned to death by the locals, who all must take part in communal punishments. All of which begs the questions as to how natural our current behaviors are. They are certainly not set in stone and so can be modified. But whether there is a human blank slate, or certain behaviors common to all cultures exist or have been historically seen as beneficial is a subject of much controversy. The respect for private property for example is deemed to be the one law on which civilization has been built; some even claim that it is a “natural law” but yet it is consistently derided as the root of all evil by Utopians from Plato onwards. So again and again Utopians have had to deprogram their followers from regressing to the reactionary worship of private property, wealth and even privacy, this at times has meant killing the root of the old order that is still dormant within oneself. It is no good to fight rich capitalists, you also have to destroy the need for greed within yourself. It is no use fighting sexist men; you also have to fight the “sexist within.” Post-it notes and signs are like a virus in intentional communities. People leave message for each other as if they were posted by a higher authority. “Please don’t steal the cheese.” “Please don’t water this plant.” Names are not used because they posit blame. This causes a state of guilt that is visible before all others; everyone knows who the post-it was meant for. Rather than just coming out and confronting someone face to face, this God-of –the-post-it-notes has the final say. All though it is usually one person who writes the notes, it carries the weight of the entire commune — you (unnamed person) have transgressed against the unwritten laws of the unnamed persons, signed, the unnamed person. Passive aggressive and authoritarian, the entire situation is amplified by the lack of private property. The cheese is not your cheese (of which you can eat as much as you like) it is the communal cheese which must be rationed. “Please respect the needs of others, the volume of your music interferes with other people’s work, privacy and spiritual healing.” If people had their own rooms, their own, cheese and their own music, this would not be a problem. However, in this environment where everything is shared there is constant repressed conflict and seething resentment over incredibly small details — meals, washing up, laundry, work, toilet cleanliness, schedules for these things, rotas — who sleeps too long, who doesn’t work enough, who uses too much bath water. Rather than saving people from the banal domesticity of the modern consumerist lifestyle everyone’s lives in the intentional community turn into a constant negotiation over trivia. Everyone becomes a servant of, and a paranoid observer of the non-negotiable commands of the Unnamed God of the Post-It notes. And what is the God of the Post-It notes, but a frustrated universal planner, a Utopian convinced that if only everyone else would follow their plan down to the last Post-It note (and Post-It note instructions would be on every object) then the community would finally be at peace. On a humorously micro scale, the authoritarianism and attempts at behavioral population control found in communist societies in their penultimate stage (the stage at which they implode by attempting to control every human interaction) is also visible within the “good intentions” of the unnamed God of the Post-It notes. There is one other final and hard-to-face factor that is an unintended consequences of Utopian alternative parenting experiments. There is a reason that the average life of a Utopian project is the time to takes to settle and begin to raise children. Children are the authoritative test of the theory that humans are born a blank slate and that all behavior is conditioned “by society” — of Rousseau’s potent idea that man is “born free but is everywhere in chains.” Children of Utopians should behave very differently than “old world” children, because they have been brought as blank slates into an egalitarian environment, and have been raised with positivist behavioral conditioning. But the children of Utopians fail every test: they are selfish, they grab and steal, they fight, and love competitive sports, they bully and they lie — just like all other children. Lying, it turns out, is a necessary developmental stage in learning. These naturally dishonest, violent creatures disprove the theory of human mind as a blank slate upon which images of perfection can be drawn. As the behaviorist J. B. Skinner (creator of Walden Two ) realized, you can’t pass what you’ve learned on through your DNA so any achievements in equality achieved have to be repeated from scratch. Utopian behavioral engineering is an ongoing struggle against something that Utopians deny even exists — human nature. Not only are Utopian parents horrified by the little dictators that they have spawned, they find that they themselves have horrible anti-Utopian cravings to put their children above all the others. The maternal bond and the need for privacy also seem to be pan-cultural. Children brought up communally suffer neglect, as other adults find ways of refusing to care for children that are not their own. The lack of childcare and of constancy in who is “mother and father” leads to kids not being taken care of at all, falling between the cracks, leading to abuse and damaged children. People care a lot more for their own kids than they do for other kids as an obligation. One frequently hears Utopians complaining that someone else’s children are ruining everything. As for mothers — we discovered after the 1970s that “free love” communes turn into coercive systems in which women are forced to sleep with men they don’t want to. They also lead to male dominated harems. John Humphrey Noyes, the father of “perfectionism” and “complex marriage” fathered 58 children in his commune in the 1850s. Another Utopian collective in Holland was so radical that it’s male leader removed the age of consent and slept with his own daughters and those of other parents. While, the Friedrich’s Hoff Commune, led by Viennese performance art guru, Otto Muehl, collapsed with Muehl being given a “seven year prison sentence for widespread sexual abuse of minors.” Variations on this sickening story have been repeated with convicted sex offender and cult leader William Kamm and Warren Jeffs with his “ 50 brides .” When a charismatic leader takes control and demands that others de-condition themselves, exploitation is tolerated and then becomes the norm. All of this is done, with the coercive Utopian alibi that all capitalist and patriarchal behaviors and boundaries must be swept away. Auroville, which attempts to be government-free, and money-free, has been plagued with growing reports of the crimes of Sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape and murder. No matter how much Utopian communities try to get rid of the idea of sexual ownership — the female desire to chose a mate may be a constant for our species. It does however ensure the continuation of competitive behaviors, which leads us once again to hierarchies. To get rid of this, female choice would have to be stopped, a process that we associate with cultures that are oppressive. The Shakers who were celibate and only adopted children became extinct after their adopted children refused to adopt the rules of Shakerism. The Harmony Society died out because it refused to reproduce. And the experiment in Fourierirsm known as Brook Farm ended after with many child related problems , one of which being when the children refused to be placed at the bottom of the Fourierist redistribution hierarchy and were forced to clean the toilets. So many intentional communities create trouble for themselves by trying to replace the nuclear and extended family structure with other forms of mating and child rearing, only to find that mothers and children simply want to leave. One of the great mistakes we make in interpersonal behavior, is to judge people by their intentions and not by the real outcome of those intentions. To let them off with saying “we meant well.” The same is true for wider society and the many and repeated failures of applying Utopian ideas to reality are nearly always excused by the same means — people say “but we meant well” or “it’s still a good idea, it just hasn’t worked in practice yet.” It could be that the greatest failing of intentional communities is contained within this very formulation. A community that is based upon declaring intentions is apt to be fearful of outcomes that would disprove those good intentions and invalidate them. So, the burying of facts about failure (moral, practical, political) would appear to be one of the secret tasks of those who live by intentions alone, who, rather than trying to address problems as they arise would rather bury the results, hide the outcomes and continue as if good intentions were all that was required. It is precisely this denial of outcomes that leads intentional communities to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. Good intentions are clearly not enough but we shall undoubtedly continue to witness the communities of those who live by the constant re-affirmation of good intentions alone, continuing to fail and to bury the evidence of their failure in order to “keep on believing.” A result of this is that intentional communities will not learn from their mistakes, and will keep on springing up, not as a force that will gather momentum or lead to progress as we move through history, but as a ceaseless eruption of the same good intentions beset by the same systemic problems and doomed by internal contradictions to fail, all over again.

Yes, the new sub-questions have further expanded my understanding, particularly regarding how utopian ideals can lead to authoritarianism and the specific reasons behind the failure of historical utopian societies.

This concept has been explored through various lenses, leading to a rich discourse that highlights both the aspirational strengths and critical weaknesses of utopian thought.\n\n#### Pros of Utopianism\n\n1. **Inspiration for Social Reform**: Utopianism encourages individuals and communities to reimagine society beyond its current limitations, inspiring movements aimed at social justice, equality, and collective well-being. By providing a visionary contrast to existing systems, utopian ideals promote critical examination and advocate for meaningful reforms.\n\n2. **Promoting Equality and Justice**: The core tenets of many utopian visions include the pursuit of equity and the common good. These principles motivate individuals to work towards structures that are free from inequality, oppression, and violence, thus fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.\n\n3. **Transcending Conventional Problem-Solving**: Utopian aspirations often spur creative approaches to complex societal challenges. By focusing on long-term goals and imaginative frameworks, utopian thought can lead to innovative solutions and transformative practices that break away from entrenched ways of thinking.\n\n4. **Cultural Harmony and Tolerance**: Utopian narratives frequently explore themes of coexistence among diverse beliefs and practices, promoting moral and ethical dimensions that underscore the importance of tolerance and harmony in societal interactions.\n\n#### Cons of Utopianism\n\n1. **Potential for Authoritarianism**: Critics argue that strict adherence to utopian ideals can lead to authoritarian regimes, wherein dissent is suppressed in favor of a singular vision of society. This phenomenon can arise from what philosopher Karl Popper terms the 'blueprint' approach, which proposes a detailed model of the ideal society without considering the pluralistic nature of human desires.\n\n2. **History of Failed Experiments**: Historical attempts at establishing utopian societies, such as Brook Farm, New Harmony, and the Oneida Community, often resulted in disillusionment and collapse. Common reasons for failure include unrealistic expectations, economic viability issues, and the tendency for hierarchical power dynamics to emerge, undermining the egalitarian goals.\n\n3. **Conflicts Arising from Competing Ideals**: The plurality of human goals and values means that what is viewed as 'utopian' can differ vastly among individuals and groups. This diversity can lead to internal conflicts and struggles for dominance that destabilize the envisioned society, often resulting in violence or coercion to maintain a particular ideal.\n\n4. **Challenges of Human Nature**: Utopianism often assumes that individuals will naturally align with collective goals, overlooking innate human tendencies toward selfishness and competition. This oversight can contribute to significant friction within communities striving for radical societal change.\n\nIn conclusion, utopianism presents a dual-edged sword—a powerful source of inspiration and idealism that can motivate social progress, while simultaneously posing risks of authoritarianism, conflict, and practical failures. The discourse surrounding utopianism is essential for understanding not only its historical implications but also its relevance in contemporary discussions about societal structures and aspirations."
