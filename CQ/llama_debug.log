2025-04-15 02:15:23,523 [DEBUG] Instructor Request: mode.value='json_mode', response_model=<class 'agent_llama.ToolCall'>, new_kwargs={'messages': [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\n   "tool_name": "question_decompose",\n   "tool_parameters": {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Recall the function correctly, fix the errors, exceptions found\n1 validation error for ToolCall\ntool_parameters\n  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value={\'graph\': [{\'parent_quest...ism\'s pros and cons."}]}, input_type=dict]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/v/string_type'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}}

[ 1 ] The term gained widespread usage following the publication of Thomas More \\\'s 1516 book Utopia . [ 2 ] Building upon the work of sociologist Ruth Levitas , [ 1 ] social psychologists have tested the functions of utopian thinking among people. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Utopia is fundamentally a cultural and psychological concept, existing solely as symbols within people\\\'s minds. [ 4 ] Empirical evidence supports the connections between utopian thinking and the three primary functions proposed by Levitas: criticism, change, and compensation. [ 2 ] Theoretical models have been developed linking utopian thinking to established social psychological concepts such as collective action and system justification . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Theoretical background [ edit ] The term "utopia" gained widespread usage following the publication of Thomas More \\\'s book "Utopia" in 1516. [ 2 ] Nevertheless, the concept of an ideal society is evident in historical records predating the coining of the term. [ 7 ] Utopian visions are prevalent across diverse nations and communities, with content variations influenced by cultural differences. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] These utopian depictions have played pivotal roles in activism, art, political discourse, and philosophical texts. [ 5 ] Importantly, utopian imagery extends beyond specific domains, frequently surfacing in everyday conversations among ordinary individuals. [ 1 ] Extensive research has delved into the diversity and characteristics of utopian images within sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Researchers have founded the Society for Utopian Studies in 1975, which publishes the multidisciplinary peer-reviewed academic journal on this topic, Utopian Studies . Levitas postulated three primary functions of utopias, emphasizing that these idealized visions play various roles for individuals and society. [ 1 ] The first function is criticism, wherein the visualization of a utopian society highlights the deficiencies of the current societal structure. The act of contrasting the ideal with the present state of society provides a clear perspective on areas in need of improvement. The second function is change, serving as a motivating force that propels individuals to actively pursue the societal goals depicted in the utopian vision. Armed with a tangible image of a superior society, individuals can channel their efforts more effectively toward the abstract goal of societal improvement. [ citation needed ] The third function is compensation, which introduces a somewhat divergent aspect. Individuals may find satisfaction in their imaginative utopian dreams, potentially leading to a reluctance to pursue actual change in reality. The psychological satisfaction derived from the imagination can inadvertently serve as a deterrent to tangible action. In summary, while utopian thinking is theorized to play a pivotal role in inspiring social action, there is a potential risk of individuals engaging in hedonic escapism, withdrawing from the real world into the comfort of their imaginative ideals. [ citation needed ] Utopian thinking encompasses the mental act of envisioning an ideal society. [ 2 ] It is conceptualized as a form of collective self-regulation by Fernando and colleagues, extending the self-regulatory function of the ideal self to the collective action domain. [ 2 ] Self-discrepancy theory has unveiled that the ideal self\\\'s image can serve as motivation for regulating cognition, emotion, and behavior, driven by the desire to minimize the discrepancy between the ideal and actual self. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Just as the ideal self can motivate individuals to pursue goals aligned with that ideal self concept, the mental representation of an ideal society has the potential to collectively motivate people toward shared objectives embedded in utopian visions. [ 2 ] In fact, prominent social psychologists specializing in social change have contended that alternative societal visions hold power to motivate the conversion of societal structures. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The acknowledgment that the current societal configuration is not the sole possibility, coupled with the act of envisioning an alternative society with desired attributes, has been posited as a pivotal catalyst for social change, according to social identity theorists . [ 17 ] In order to empirically explore the association between utopian thinking and its psychological functions, Fernando and colleagues devised a Utopianism scale, conducted correlational studies, and executed experimental studies. [ 2 ] Individuals\\\' inherent tendencies toward engaging in utopian thinking were found to be connected to the criticism, change, and compensation functions. Those prompted to articulate "an ideal or best possible society which is hoped or wished for" exhibited heightened intentions to partake in citizenship behaviors compared to a control group, providing evidence for the correlation between utopian thinking and the change function. Those who depicted their utopian images also demonstrated reduced satisfaction with the current society, substantiating the postulated relationship between utopian thinking and the criticism function. However, the compensation function did not exhibit elevated levels in response to experimentally induced utopian thinking. The researchers posited that the connection between utopian thinking and the compensation function could be moderated by the perceived likelihood of success of collective action. This implies that individuals could lean more towards escapism when the prospect of societal change is perceived as low. Additionally, the researchers noted that the functions of utopian thinking, viewed as both an individual difference and a situational influence, might differ. Dispositional utopian thinking exhibited a stronger predictive link with change functions, while experimental utopian thinking did not predict compensation functions. In summary, a meta-analysis unveiled an overall positive impact of utopian thinking on criticism, change, and compensation, although the effect sizes varied across studies. [ 2 ] To comprehend the mechanisms underlying the impact of utopian thinking on its functions, one of the aforementioned experimental studies investigated the influence of the sequence in which individuals contemplated utopian societies and their current reality. [ 2 ] Oettingen\\\'s research on fantasy realization, [ 18 ] [ 19 ] which posits that mentally contrasting desired states with reality is instrumental in motivating goal-directed behavior, established that merely envisioning a fantasy is insufficient to stimulate goal-oriented actions. Instead, it is imperative to contrast the fantasy with the realities of the current situation, thereby engaging individuals in contemplating potential methods to achieve the envisioned outcome. Building on Oettingen\\\'s framework, Fernando and colleagues hypothesized and tested the notion that initiating utopian visions followed by a contrast with reality would be more effective in eliciting the functions of utopia, as opposed to initiating thoughts with the current reality and then introducing utopian ideals. [ 2 ] The research team found empirical support for the idea that contrasting the current society after contemplating utopia is more effective in eliciting criticism and change functions. In contrast, the reverse order of utopian thinking did not yield a significant effect compared to a control group that did not engage in utopian contemplation. [ citation needed ] Utopian thinking could be incorporated and add significant value to existing models that explain collective action . [ 6 ] The impact of utopian thinking extends to both conventionally conceptualized collective actions and more generic civic behaviors. [ 2 ] The former indicates participation in a social movement toward a shared goal with others, [ 20 ] while the latter refers to heightened engagement in society in any domain, whether or not in the company of like-minded individuals. [ 21 ] Utopias could be constructed around a certain group identity, such as a feminist utopia, or could generally inspire imagination of an alternative better version of society, without pertaining to a group membership. [ 2 ] The former will instill motivation for collective actions intended to achieve certain collective goals, for instance, achieving a feminist society. The latter will contribute to enhanced interest to be engaged with societal processes. [ citation needed ] The Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA), [ 20 ] a prominent collective action theory, posits group identity, injustice/anger, and moral conviction as primary motivators for participation. While group identification has been recognized as a pivotal motivator for collective action, utopian thinking introduces a pathway that can stimulate participation without necessitating a specific group affiliation. [ 6 ] Conceiving a cognitive alternative through thinking about utopias without belonging to a specific ingroup is found to enhance collective action intentions. [ 6 ] Furthermore, utopian thinking has the potential to instigate the formation of entirely new groups, thereby strengthening motivations for collective action through the tie of group identification and collective action as well. [ 6 ] Researchers have conceptualized what they term "opinion-based groups," where similar opinions are the basis of group identification. [ 22 ] Shared utopian visions could serve as the basis for new group formations. [ 6 ] Smith and colleagues have theorized that the perceiving disparity between the current state of affairs and the envisioned ideal could give rise to a novel identity, [ 23 ] which is highly relevant to the process of utopian thinking as well. [ 6 ] Overcome system justification [ edit ] In the inaugural empirical exploration of utopian thinking, it has consistently emerged that such thinking diminishes system justification . [ 2 ] Notably, Jost and colleagues underscored utopian thinking as a promising approach in their recent review of system justification. [ 24 ] Building upon this foundation, Badaan and colleagues have proposed a comprehensive framework that interlinks the study of utopian thinking, collective action, and system justification. [ 5 ] Within this model, two proposed mechanisms mediate the relationship between utopian thinking and the motivation for system justification: hope and abstraction . The first pathway is the affective route, wherein utopian thinking reduces system justification by fostering an increase in social hope. The second pathway is the cognitive-motivational route, wherein utopian thinking diminishes system justification by priming higher-level construal or abstraction. [ citation needed ] The authors highlight that hope, as an emotion, is nuanced and not merely a naive or optimistic outlook. [ 5 ] Hope transcends a positive expectation toward a goal; it inherently involves contemplating and implementing tangible methods to achieve that goal. [ 25 ] Understanding hope is pivotal in mobilizing social action towards change, as the absence of hope leaves no motivation for initiating and sustaining the often arduous efforts required to achieve the goal of social change. [ 26 ] Specifically, social hope pertains to the emotion an individual harbors for the future of society at large, extending beyond personal concerns. [ 10 ] The act of envisioning an ideal society through utopian thinking is proposed to have the capacity to evoke hope and instill the belief that the utopian dream is indeed attainable. [ 5 ] Mental abstraction emerges as a crucial pathway, enabling individuals to explore cognitive alternatives that may not be readily accessible in their daily concrete thought processes. [ 5 ] Abstraction proves effective in bringing distant goals, such as social change, closer to our cognitive forefront. [ 27 ] The greater the level of abstraction in imagining utopia, the more significant the impact in rendering cognitive alternatives accessible in our minds. [ 28 ] High-level construals, associated with abstract thinking, are also known to motivate self-control behaviors. [ 29 ] Applied in the context of social change, the abstract contemplation of an ideal society is likely to trigger self-control behaviors, prompting individuals to adopt strategies for fostering societal change. [ 5 ] To scrutinize these pathways, researchers manipulated utopian thinking by having participants read an article describing either a utopian society or the current society. [ 3 ] A structural equation model shed light on the relationships between variables. Utopian thinking increased both personal and social hope, subsequently elevating both system justification and collective action. The authors propose that this elevation might stem from the overlap in measures between hope and system justification, as certain items in the hope scale suggest that society is progressing in the right direction without major problems. Additionally, utopian thinking increased abstract thinking but exhibited only a marginal association with intentions for collective action. The authors elucidate that the measure for abstraction predominantly tapped into dispositional rather than situational aspects, making it less susceptible to change through utopian priming. [ citation needed ] Utopia and dystopia [ edit ] The antithesis to the concept of utopia is dystopia , representing a society that elicits fear and embodies the worst imaginable conditions. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Both utopian and dystopian visions share the commonality of existing solely within the realm of human imagination, diverging significantly from the realities of contemporary society. Utopian ideals serve as a motivational force for societal participation, guiding collective efforts toward the realization of an envisioned ideal society. [ 2 ] Dystopian thinking can similarly prompt societal engagement but in a manner distinct from utopian ideals. Dystopian societies, feared and avoided by individuals, stimulate preventive behaviors aimed at averting the realization of such nightmarish scenarios. [ 32 ] The functionality of dystopian thinking can also be elucidated through the framework of collective self-regulation. [ 4 ] The concept of "ought selves" propels individuals towards self-improvement driven by fear. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Analogously, dystopian visions motivate societal involvement with the goal of steering the societal structure away from the envisaged dystopian nightmare. [ 4 ] This engagement also aligns with the change and criticism functions proposed by Levitas within the framework of utopian thinking. [ 4 ] Moderating role of content [ edit ] Evidently, participants exhibit a diverse array of responses when prompted with utopian thinking scenarios. [ 6 ] Several studies have delved into the significance of these varied responses, aiming to discern whether specific utopian contents prove more effective in eliciting the functions of utopia compared to others. [ 6 ] [ 33 ] Fernando and colleagues contrasted two prototypical utopias: the Green utopia and the Sci-Fi utopia. [ 6 ] The former envisions a communal society dedicated to environmental protection and equitable resource sharing, while the latter portrays a society endowed with boundless resources, thanks to technological advancements. [ citation needed ] Upon priming with the Green utopia, individuals demonstrated a greater likelihood of expressing intentions for general societal participation. Conversely, the priming of Sci-Fi utopias did not yield a similar increase in societal engagement. The authors posit that societies perceived as fostering greater interpersonal warmth are more effective in motivating intentions for change. [ 34 ] It is important to note that this study focused on the impact of specific utopian priming on generic change intentions, and thus, it does not provide insights into the effect on behaviors within specific domains. [ citation needed ] Political orientation [ edit ] Despite employing the same prompt in empirical studies to induce utopian thinking across participants, the responses\\\' content exhibits variations influenced by an array of sociocultural factors. [ 4 ] Among these factors, political orientation stands out as a prominent determinant in shaping the contents of utopian imagination. [ 5 ] An examination of social media discourses, employing machine-learning methods, revealed that liberal and conservative users articulated different themes when envisioning ideal societies. [ 35 ] Nevertheless, there were overarching themes common to utopian visions across both political orientations. Both liberal and conservative perspectives consistently emphasized the value of family, community, economic prosperity, and the pursuit of health, happiness, and freedom. However, notable differences surfaced in the specific themes highlighted by each group. Liberals tended to prioritize themes such as social justice, global inequality, women\\\'s rights, racism, criminal justice, healthcare, poverty, progress, social change, personal growth, and environmental sustainability. In contrast, conservatives more frequently centered their discussions around themes related to religion, social order, business, capitalism, national symbols, immigration, and terrorism. In conclusion, both diverging and converging themes are found across political orientations. [ citation needed ] Cross-cultural development research method [ edit ] Development agencies, exemplified by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) , establish overarching development agendas that nations can collaboratively pursue. [ 36 ] To ensure the efficacy and cultural relevance of these agendas, it is crucial to formulate them in a manner that resonates with the unique local contexts of individual countries. Although the UNDP has made strides in enhancing cultural sensitivity over time, there has been criticism of some development goals for their lack of cultural nuance. [ 37 ] Badaan and Choucair (2023) propose the adoption of utopian thinking as a methodology for constructing contextualized development agendas. This approach involves soliciting input from people worldwide regarding the type of world they envision, analyzing these responses, and incorporating the findings into development agendas. By doing so, development agencies can comprehensively capture the diverse aspirations for change across nations, cultures, and communities. Qualitative methods such as interviews, focus group discussions, and open-ended surveys are particularly well-suited to leverage the utopian thinking framework. [ 37 ] An inherent advantage of the utopian thinking approach is its potential to actively engage individuals in the process of social change. [ 37 ] Through the act of envisioning and articulating the societal conditions they desire, people are more likely to contemplate and visualize the kind of environment in which they wish to reside. This process has been found to stimulate increased intentions for societal participation. [ 2 ] Furthermore, priming ‘Green utopia’ when asking about an utopian society has been demonstrated to catalyze broader social change intentions and behaviors. [ 6 ] This suggests that utopian thinking can effectively draw attention to and raise awareness about critical social issues. [ 37 ] Another notable advantage is the potential for development agencies to gather accurate information about the cultural nuances of various countries and regions. [ 37 ] By directly consulting with individuals who will both shape and be impacted by these changes, agencies can construct goals that are attuned to the specific needs of different contexts. This approach facilitates the identification of both universal and culturally specific issues, enabling the development of more nuanced interventions that account for regional differences. [ 37 ] However, the implementation of the utopian thinking method raises realistic concerns. [ 37 ] Firstly, the content of utopian imaginations may vary drastically, with some proposals aiming to enhance societal well-being, while others may advocate exclusionary visions detrimental to certain groups of society. Striking a balance between upholding human rights principles and navigating contradictory views within cultures is imperative. [ 37 ] Besides, qualitative data collection from a diverse population demands more time and resources compared to alternative methods, necessitating a consideration of the tradeoff between efficiency and cultural sensitivity.

[ou-topos = not-place] The etymology of this word which literally translates to a place that doesn’t exist, is representative of an idealistic stream of thought, something utopian socialists platformed in the early 19 th century. Utopian Socialism, although not an established and homogenous school of thought, refers to the ideas of Welsh manufacturer and social reformer Robert Owen and French philosophers Henri de Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier. A reaction to the prevailing economic system which prioritised private interests at the expense of the working class, Utopian socialism denoted the belief that society can and must voluntarily transition away from capitalism into a society run by co-operation and harmony. Emerging at an early stage of Capitalist development, Utopian socialists witnessed the consequences of unregulated economic growth and shared a sense of outrage at the suffering and waste produced by early capitalism. This also explains the ambiguity surrounding ‘Utopian Socialist’ theory for the anti-capitalist rhetoric was first articulated in great detail by Marx, Engels, and other socialist thinkers. The French and Industrial Revolutions which they had witnessed, produced a breakdown of traditional values and community bonds, causing individual detachment from work. Thinkers like Fourier noticed society was becoming increasingly hostile, fragmented and individualistic. Utopian socialism thus emerged as an idea in response to this detachment, what Marx later called ‘Alienation.’ Utopian Socialists attributed societal evil to Egoism which followers of Saint-Simon called, “the deepest wound of modern society.” These notions and observations helped cement anti-capitalist thought and set the foundation for the development of modern socialist doctrines. Utopian socialists failed to provide articulate critical analyses for the social conditions they disagreed with, but their ideals and aims are clear. Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Owen sought to set up communities which were ruled by principles of justice, benevolence, and cooperation. Characteristic features of Utopian Socialism Ethical Reform- The utopia that these socialists aimed to create were ethically homogenous communities based on values of harmony, association and co-operation. The ideas proposed by Utopian socialists were ethical in nature, as opposed to scientific or even economic. These thinkers strongly believed that a clear conscience and good morals could transcend class warfare and allow owners and workers to live and work communally. Voluntary transformations- Utopian socialists came of age in an era characterised by optimistic perspectives, hope and a romantic faith in unbounded progress. Social perfectibility, can thus be found at the crux of all their theories. They believed in peaceful transformations of society and that Industrialists/ capitalists would voluntarily reconfigure the system and share it with the working class. Science + Religion: A striking feature of Utopian Socialist thought was that, although these thinkers presented their work as the articulation of a truly objective understanding of the laws of human nature and industrial society, they also seemed to adopt a religious tone. These laws of human nature were also the laws of God and hence, their utopian science became an articulation of true religion. This allowed them to blend both science and religion, prophecy and sociology Utopian socialist Experiments Every Utopian Socialist managed to construct his utopia on a small scale. Some of these experiments include: Saint Simon The first Utopian Socialist experiment was carried out by the Saint-Simonians. These followers regarded Henri de Saint Simon as a prophet of this new world in which science and co-operation could create material change and propel the moral regeneration of humanity. In 1825, soon after his death, his followers started journals and organized lecture tours designed to elaborate and spread his ideas. By 1830 they had created a new religion that aimed at utilizing the productive forces of the emerging industrial society, to alleviate the ills imposed on the poor and consequently fill what they perceived to be as a religious and moral vacuum of their era. These societies were made illegal in France in 1830 but still sustained its influence worldwide till 1848, boasting more than 40,000 adherents. According to Keith Taylor, in his book ‘Political Ideas of the Utopian Socialists’: the saint Simonian movement was experiencing internal turmoil over moral and religious questions. The rejection of Christianity and desire to create a new religion with new moral and social codes including a more liberal approach towards sexual relations and marriage, did not reflect mass opinion. He adds that towards the end of the 1830’s the movement began to tilt towards authoritarianism with Prosper Enfantin declaring himself ‘Supreme Father’, banishing ‘heretics and advocating a ‘rehabilitation of the flesh’ Robert Owen: Robert Owen established seven communities in Britain between 1825 and 1847 and one in New Harmony, Indiana which was arguably the most successful. A cooperative society, this community boasted the first kindergarten, the first trade school, the first free library, and the first community-supported public school in the US. These societies comprised of between 500 and 1,500 people who would engage industrial and agricultural production. In the early 1830’s, the ‘Owenites’ engaged in labour organisation and made a large effort to create a national federation of trade unions. The Owenites predominantly spent their time attempting to create working-class communities in which property was collectively owned and socio-economic activity was organised in a cooperative manner. These societies succeeded for much of the 19 th century but not much is known about exactly why they failed. Charles Fourier Charles Fourier posited that most of the problems he observed arose from the dislocation between people’s passions and the manner in which society functioned. He believed that this conflict could be resolved with the establishment of these so-called phalanxes, or communes. Between 1841 and 1859, about 28 phalanxes were established in the United States. The relative success of Fourier’s experiments can be attributed to their small scale and anti-industrial outlook which provided refuge to agricultural workers and craftsman who were anxious about their employment in their rapidly industrializing society. Simultaneously, Fourier’s phalanxes were said to be badly led and organised, with Fourier expecting the charity of benevolent capitalists to help operate his schemes. As organisation began to improve, the phalanxes began to inch towards being a religious community centred around Fourier who was perceived as a messiah at this point. Keith Taylor states that splits in the Fourierist leadership can also be credited with the movement’s failure in France. These phalanxes in America however, began to thrive, they were considered to be libertarian and anti-authoritarian in outlook. The movement was in effect, so liberal that the French government tolerated it and allowed it to thrive without interruption, unlike the communities of the Saint-Simonians. Etienne Cabet Inspired by Thomas Mores utopia, Etienne Cabet wrote ‘Voyage to Icaria’ In 1839. Cabet’s Icaria called for perfect equality and was highly democratic in terms of the popular participation it entertained. This community attracted 100,000 to 200,000 thousand people, mainly working-class folk such as artisans who were insecure about their employment as industrial societies began to mechanise production. Icarian societies were established all over France, and one group set sail to America in 1848, where one community persevered until the end of the 19 th Century. Keith Taylor mentions that Icarianism’s founding ideas lacked coherence, stating that these communities did not survive increasing governmental persecution in the late 1840’s and that there were also failures of leadership.’ Critique Utopian Socialism was arguably platformed by Engels who introduced this concept by critiquing it in his 1880 book, ‘Socialism: Utopian and Scientific.’ Radical socialist thinkers ascribed the label ‘utopian’ to refer to the naivete of the theory, calling it fanciful and unrealistic. Making the case for socialism on moral grounds, several socialists dismissed the work of these utopian thinkers, on the basis of its failure to acknowledge the class struggle, liberation, and the analysis of actual material conditions. Due to the time in with these ideas were birthed, these theories were not able to critically analyze nor comment on the liberation of all oppressed groups. Slavery was still legal when Robert Owens established his utopian community in Indiana; the liberation of the working class, for them, was not extended to black people in the neighbouring farms. Several Saint-Simonites were also in favour of the French colonization of North Africa, neglecting both colonialism and imperialism from their analysis of poor social conditions caused by capitalism. Adopting an unrealistic and illusory approach, the optimism which streaks all utopian ideas was criticized heavily by emerging socialist thinkers. Utopian socialists believed that members of the ruling class could easily reconcile social conditions and ease the transition into a utopia, their theories neglect class struggle and actively advocate against seizing the means of production through revolution. Nonetheless, modern Socialist discourse lying at the intersection of idealistic and more pragmatic currents, appears so only because of the utopian characteristic of early socialist thought. This ideology provided a loose framework for revolutionary leaders and theorists to build off of, creating a comprehensive and elaborate articulation of what Socialism truly means.

More coupled the Greek words ou (no, or not) and topos (place) to invent a name that has since passed into nearly universal currency. Further verbal play shows the close relation between utopia and eutopia , which means "the good [or happy] place." Through the succeeding centuries this double aspect has marked the core of utopian literature, which has employed the imaginary to project the ideal. (This is not to deny that More\\\'s own attitude towards the ideal society he imagined may well have been ambivalent.) The words utopia and utopian, however, have been put to many uses besides the one suggested by More\\\'s book. Common to all uses is reference to either the imaginary or the ideal, or to both. But sometimes the words are used as terms of derision and sometimes with a vagueness that robs them of any genuine usefulness. For example, a proposal that is farfetched or implausible is often condemned as utopian, whether or not the proposal has any idealistic content. In another, closely related pejorative use, utopian designates that which is unacceptably different from the customary or is radical in its demands. The connotation of impossibility or complete impracticality serves to discredit a threatening idealism. Similarly, daydreams and fantasies — psychologically driven and frequently bizarre expressions of private ideals — are called utopian, as if utopia were synonymous with deviant or deranged thinking. Even when the word is used without hostility, its coverage is enormously wide. Almost any expression of idealism — a view of a better life, a statement of basic political commitments, a plea for major reform in one or another sector of social life — can earn for itself the title utopian. Furthermore, all literary depictions of imaginary societies are called utopian, even if they are actually dystopias (bad places) that represent some totalitarian or fiendish horror, or are primarily futuristic speculations about technical and scientific possibilities that have no important connection to any idealism. Much historical experience is reflected in this variety of usage. Indeed, the ways in which utopia (and utopian) are used can be symptomatic of prevailing attitudes towards social change in general. Nevertheless, clarity could be served if we see the core of utopianism as speculation, in whatever literary form, about ideal societies and ideal ways of life for whole populations, in which perfection, defined in accordance with common prepossessions and not merely personal predilections, is aimed at. Perfection is conceived of as harmony, the harmony of each person with himself or herself and with the rest of society. (If there must always be war, then utopian war is waged only against outsiders.) The tradition of utopian thought, in this core sense, is thus made up of elaborated ideas, images, and visions of social harmony. Not discussed in this entry is dystopian speculation in many genres about the near or distant future, in which the condition of human life is degraded or deformed. In many cases, dystopia shares with utopia a total vision of an imaginary society; but a deliberate hell, not a planned heaven. What brings such a condition into being is zeal to maintain the power of the ruling group, not the project of human well-being. An oppressive and tenacious dictatorship holds sway. The most famous example is the sadistic dystopia of George Orwell \\\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Inspiration of Utopianism The forerunners of the utopian tradition are the fables and myths of the golden age, the Garden of Eden , or some benign state of nature. These inherited stories, although of considerable antiquity, look back to some even more remote time in the misty past when harmony was allegedly the normal condition of life. Remorse or nostalgia is the usual accompaniment of these stories. Reality is not what it was, and worldly good sense holds that it is not likely that life will ever be again what it was — except perhaps through some divine intercession. An uncontrived harmony characterized the primal felicity. Simple people led lives as simple as themselves; because human nature was undeveloped, they were easily made content. If the glories and pleasures of civilization were missing, so were its artificialities, corruptions, and physical and psychological sufferings. Whenever disgust or disenchantment with civilization has become acute, these old stories are retold in order to expose the faults of civilization. But apart from their role in this fundamentally self-conscious method of striking at an existing order, these stories are primarily interesting as repositories of the age-old longings of ordinary humanity. All that the world is not is summed up in short and supposedly seductive descriptions. Sometime long ago, when people were still in touch with their uncontaminated nature, they lived without domination, irrational inequality, scarcity, brutalizing labor, warfare, and the tortures of conscience; they lived without disharmony in any form. The good life is, in the first instance, defined by the absence of these things. Although fondness for an early simplicity may seem regressive — an ignoble attachment to a primitive and subhuman harmony — a principal impetus for utopianism is undeniably to be found here. The later tradition not only fills out the picture that is only a sketch in the old myths, but more important, transcends the old myths. Whatever wistfulness for the golden age may be present, there is general agreement that primal harmony cannot be regained. The condition of harmony, which defines the good life, must be civilized. It may be more or less complex, more or less scientific, more or less abundant, more or less hierarchical, more or less free, but it must be organized and institutionally articulated (and almost always governed). Throughout the utopian tradition, reality is not defied to the extent of wishing away the idea of a settled society. In Plato\\\'s Republic , Socrates can dwell only briefly on the excellence of an amiably anarchic rusticity (no war, no class-strife, no politics, no meat-eating, no philosophy or sciences or high art) before his admirer Glaucon, with the stinging phrase "city of pigs," forces him to turn his thoughts to the ideal city (the city of justice, which is founded on the initial unjust act of taking land from others). This transition can be taken as typical of utopianism as a whole. Varieties of Utopianism Even with a scrupulous adherence to the definition of utopianism as the succession of ideas, images, and visions of social harmony, the relevant texts are extremely numerous. The main types of utopias include, first, and most properly utopian, descriptions of imaginary societies held to be perfect or much closer to perfection than any society in the real world. They are located in the past, present, or future and are contained in treatise, novel, story, or poem with varying degrees of detailed specification and imaginative inventiveness. The second type of utopia — closely allied to the first — is found in those works of political theory in which reflection on the fundamental questions of politics leads the theorist beyond politics to consider the social and cultural presuppositions of the ideal political order and the ends of life which that political order (placed in a certain social and cultural setting) can and should facilitate. Whereas the political theorist comes to the forms and purposes of all institutional life by way of political concerns and, as it were, incidentally, the intentionally utopian writer, with Thomas More as the model, works out from the start a comprehensive view of the ideal society and its way of life, a view in which political forms need not be of central importance. Some works of political theory — Plato\\\'s Republic , for example — so capably discuss nonpolitical matters that they fit into either category. Those philosophies of history that culminate in a vision of achieved perfection are a third cluster of writings that are not imaginary projections of the ideal but display instead metaphysical optimism of a total kind. These are the theories of inevitable progress created by such thinkers as the Marquis de Condorcet, Herbert Spencer , and Karl Marx . Marx, for one, indignantly fought against inclusion in the utopian tradition because he presented himself as an antiutopian realist blessed with unique insight into the nature of the historical process and its necessary workings carried even to the future, not as an idealist preaching to the world an ahistorical conception of the ideal. For all that, others have taken his writings as belonging in the utopian tradition. Roughly, the same holds for Spencer and some other philosophers of history. No list of the major sources of utopian literature would be acceptable without theorists of inevitable progress. Fourth are those works — sometimes called philosophical anthropologies — in which the writer attempts not only to isolate the instincts, traits, and capacities that are peculiar to humanity among all species in nature, but also to specify what is genuinely human rather than merely conventional, and what human growth and fuller realization would be. These discourses are not always consciously utopian; they may be directed to individual reformation or to preparation for the afterlife. Furthermore, the discussion may be carried on without reference to concrete social practices and institutions. That is, philosophical anthropologies aim to assess the various kinds of human activity, the various pleasures open to human beings, or the various styles of life made possible by advancing civilization or cumulatively progressive science. A few examples are Schiller\\\'s On the Aesthetic Education of Man (1795), Ernst Bloch \\\'s The Principle of Hope (1955 – 1959), Herbert Marcuse \\\'s Eros and Civilization (1955), and Norman O. Brown\\\'s Love\\\'s Body (1966). But despite the abstract quality of philosophical anthropology, and whatever the intentions of a given writer, it would be unduly constrictive to omit altogether this literature from an account of utopianism. When its idealism is manifest, philosophical anthropology is thus highly relevant to or allied with utopianism. In the fifth group are prophecies of profound alteration for the better in human existence made by religious groups, statements of purpose made by revolutionary groups, and blueprints offered by individuals, sects, and secular associations. Obviously, not all activist and reformist political and religious groups have sought to remake society completely, in conformity with the utopian aim of harmony. Nevertheless, many groups have not been satisfied merely to speculate about the ideal society but have sought to realize it, either by persuasion or violence. Examples are the sixteenth-century Anabaptist millenarian, or chiliastic, movements in Europe, radical Protestant groups in the English civil war in the middle of the seventeenth century, and some of the marginal radical figures in the French Revolution , such as Gracchus Babeuf. And in the nineteenth century, especially in the United States , small bands of eager people, religious or simply high-minded, formed utopian communities on unoccupied land, enclaves in isolation from the larger society. Some residues continued to exist after the nineteenth century. In the second half of the twentieth century, for example, a few communal utopian experiments in the United States were inspired by Walden Two (1948), the utopian novel by B. F. Skinner, a behavioral psychologist. Causes of Utopianism The literature of social harmony is thus extensive and diverse. Some periods and some cultures have been richer in utopianism than others. The question therefore arises as to why some persons become utopian in their thought or, more rarely, in their action. What causes the desire for change to be absolute, the character of idealism to be extreme and uncompromising, the passion for harmony so averse to the normal condition of dispute and dissonance? Several answers are found scattered in the history of utopianism; some indicate urgency, others do not. First, some intellectuals simply need to invent worlds. The construction of a utopia, even if only on paper, is a godlike act and resembles the creation of a fictional world by the nonutopian novelist. A utopia can thus be an effort at mastering the complexity of social phenomena; part of the effort consists of rearranging social phenomena to form a more rational or beautiful pattern. In short, one impulse that sustains utopianism, from Plato to the latest science fiction , is to give imagination free rein. This is serious intellectual playfulness. (The same could be said about philosophers of inevitable progress, howsoever they present their optimism.) Another cause is the desire for moral clarity. In the course of carrying one\\\'s demands on social reality as far as possible, one may achieve a fixed — potentially rigid — position in relation to that reality. As a consequence, reality can be constantly put to the test. To the utopian writer, improvisation that allows purposes to emerge from the onrush of experience or waits for new means to suggest or impose new ends is nothing more than a passive or complacent or naive immersion in reality or a confused and unprepared reception of it. Although utopian writers may do nothing to improve society, they may still deem it worthwhile to preserve the concept of the ideal. This may be thought desirable even in comparatively decent societies; to insist on the distinction between the acceptable and the ideal can have a chastening influence on those who govern as well as on those who happily go along. The utopian writer in all varieties of utopianism promotes dissatisfaction and self-criticism, with the risk, of course, of simultaneously provoking a reinvigorated defense of the status quo. A further cause of utopian thought — and one that lacks the quality of comparative detachment present in the two preceding ones — is the wish to subject society to a total indictment. What is involved here is not a sense that things could be, or may always be, much better than they are but that everything, or nearly everything, is intolerable — inhumanly oppressive — and deserves to go under. There is the direct, unappeasable indictment of established institutions, the way of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his discourses, William Blake in some of his long poems, Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto , or D. H. Lawrence in his two books on the unconscious. In works of this sort hatred of social reality may be stronger than love of any alternative; the positive utopianism may be only implicit. Other works propose, in contrast, that existing social conditions are a spurious utopia: the mass pleasures, whether technological or licentious, provided by affluent society block the way to a genuine transformation of the human condition into a genuine utopia. Such was the theme of the Frankfurt School of social critique in the middle third of the twentieth century. The indictment of society is indirect when the utopianism is explicit and the practices of the ideal society are sketched. And because the main aim is to indict, the practices of the ideal society are, at least in large part, the contradiction of those in existence. The utopian imagination in these instances is hemmed in by the grave defects of the real world; the urge is strong to replace them by conditions that in no way resemble them or to discredit them intellectually. Utopian writing so motivated may blend into radical satire aimed at the status quo and produce a work as great as Jonathan Swift \\\'s Gulliver\\\'s Travels (1726). Or it may produce works such as William Morris \\\'s News from Nowhere (1891) that are plainly archaistic and may expose themselves to the charge of immaturity or irrelevance. Almost all utopian works contain curiosities and excesses, which may often be explained as compensatory responses to especially terrible features of the real world. A similar cause of utopian thought is tactical. There are times when it may appear to those bent on reforming society that overstatement is necessary for some degree of success. That is, utopian works need not harbor utopian intentions or even an abstract utopian commitment. Although writers may lavish great energy on making their utopias plausible and attractive, they may aspire only to contribute to the gradual and partial amelioration of their societies. By painting fair pictures of felicity and suggesting that the world is, as presently made up, remote from that felicity, they may encourage an innovating spirit. At the same time, these utopias will give at least guidelines for reform. There may be no real expectation that the utopia will ever fully materialize or, indeed, that pure felicity can be had on any terms. Nevertheless, without that exaggeration, less-than-utopian reform would perhaps be too modest or too slow. Much depends on the persuasiveness of the writer\\\'s scheme. For that reason the utopias of reform tend to be less free in their speculation and are content to suggest the completion of certain good tendencies in the real world rather than trying to overturn it theoretically. Edward Bellamy \\\'s Looking Backward, 2000 – 1887 (1888) is an example of this tactic. The last cause of utopian thought is the most obvious — the conviction that the whole truth about human well-being in a setting of social harmony is known, can be imparted, and should be acted on. There is, of course, a wide variety in the historical situations that call forth such an overweening attitude. But if some radical Protestant groups (such as the German Anabaptists of the sixteenth century), some utopian movements of the nineteenth century (such as those inspired by the Comte de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier , and Robert Owen ), and those Marxists who are quasi-utopian are exemplary, there must be a sense of deep, intolerable wrong. There must also be a sense of enormous possibility, of not only righting the wrong but also going beyond to perfection itself, and either an overpowering group- or self-confidence or the conviction that the utopian leaders and their following are the instruments of some higher will or the culmination of some impersonal process. The word messianism perhaps best summarizes some manifestations of this utopian spirit. Uses of Utopianism Apart from their place in history, of what use are the works of utopianism? When utopian writings are deliberate constructions of whole societies, readers may think that utopianism is simply a scattering of uninhabited palaces — grand imaginary structures that may amuse realists if not filling them with contempt. But utopianism is more than its core, the deliberate constructions made by the imagination. The utopian aspiration is found in various modes of writing, and is sometimes oblique or even hidden. Is there, however, something of enduring value, in all these modes, even the deliberate constructions, apart from any question of application? There are, in fact, several benefits conferred by utopianism. As already noted, a cause of utopian writing is playful delight in the act of imagining new kinds of social reality. This delight can be answered by the pleasure the reader takes in the results of that playfulness. The standards for judging utopianism (in any of its modes) from this point of view are primarily aesthetic — plausible novelties in the projected way of life, clever and ingenious details, daring departures from customary practices. The inner coherence of the utopian ideal matters more than any closeness to probability, although naturally too much strain on belief weakens the pleasure. Admiration for the skill of the utopian writer may be mixed with appreciation for being allowed to contemplate what it would mean to live other lives. No stimulus to make one\\\'s own better need be felt. This may make the utopian enterprise somewhat precious, but it can be a source of guiltless satisfaction even to the most conservative temperaments. The utopian works of H. G. Wells are famous for their power to gratify the taste for sampling different worlds, however else they may instruct. A second use of utopianism is as a record of human aspiration. For the record to be complete, many other kinds of utterance must be consulted, but the various modes of utopianism supply a valuable indication. They are peculiarly vivid forms taken by changeable human longings underlain by permanent human wants. Read with due allowance for their often lopsided or eccentric quality, they will shed vivid light on their times. The desperation of a given historical period, together with the limits of its hopefulness, may emerge from a study of its utopian writings. The abundance or paucity of utopian writing is itself an aid to understanding a period. Third is the contribution of several modes of utopian literature to general sociology. The great constructed utopias — Plato\\\'s Republic and Laws , the relevant parts of Aristotle\\\'s Politics , More\\\'s Utopia , Tommaso Campanella \\\'s The City of the Sun (1623), Morelly\\\'s Code de la nature (1755), the writings of Saint-Simon and Fourier (early nineteenth century), H. G. Wells\\\'s A Modern Utopia (1905) — incorporate a great deal of sociological wisdom. Common to these and other utopias is the idea of the integration of social institutions in its most intense version, utopian harmony. To utopian writers no habit or practice seems innocent of significance for the proper maintenance of the utopian society. Utopian writers are therefore constantly pointing out connections between things that appear unrelated. Part of utopian analysis consists in the attempt to identify the major elements of society and to demonstrate how they act on one another and how each must be adjusted to the others if the best possible world is to be attained. For all their care, utopian writers commit a radical abstraction when they create their images of perfection, but this is the price paid by all general sociology, including that which is wholly neutral and descriptive. The last use of utopianism is moral. Utopian literature (including the literature relevant or allied to it) is a repository of reflection on human nature. Although not directly concerned to expose frailty, to scrutinize motives, and to astonish with cynical revelations, utopian literature has in it much hard psychological intelligence. Utopian writers disagree among themselves on the extent to which human nature is reformable, but rarely is this problem treated lightly. Indeed, it is usually acknowledged as the problem requiring the deepest study; it is also the source of the greatest hesitation. The principal mission of utopianism is to encourage the hope that human nature is changeable for the better beyond the limits assigned by worldly pessimism or theological despair. That the real world, despite its amazing pluralist variety, still does not exhaust the possibilities of human nature is the heart of utopianism. The long series of utopian texts enlarge the world by suggesting new character types and new social milieus in which these types could emerge. They also enlarge the world by their claim that the societies of the world ignore, repress, distort, or destroy human potentialities that have not yet been fulfilled. It is true that the concept of harmony rules out some segment of the spectrum of human nature. The essence of antiutopianism is the charge that any imaginable utopia, like any generous philosophical anthropology, actually impoverishes human nature by not allowing scope to those traits — wildness, excess, discontent, perversity, risk-taking, heroism — that threaten harmony. If therefore the precondition of a harmonious life is the thorough manageability of people, allegedly for their own good, human nature must suffer a terrible diminution. Such diminution is the awful hidden human sacrifice that utopianism exacts with a good conscience. What intensity of experience, what craving for more than satisfaction, what passion for the unknown and the unlimited, would be left? Humanity should always face difficulties that are impossible or nearly impossible to overcome. For many people, perhaps most, utopia can and does already appear in experiences and temporary conditions, in moments and episodes, in the world as it is. Each person\\\'s utopia is different from everyone else\\\'s. Utopia cannot be an uninterrupted and common way of life for a whole society. The only genuine utopia is actual life, and every proposed utopia is a dystopia. The critique of utopianism is without doubt a rich field and numbers Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among its luminaries. A shrewd and witty antiutopian satire is Aldous Huxley\\\'s novel Brave New World (1932). A related antiutopian theme is that utopias are often driven by a strong passion for equality that threatens to efface all that is fine or rare in life or that can be created by or appeal to only a few. Utopias level society and thus work to make people more or less uniform and interchangeable; preaching individual expressive growth, utopias often destroy the social and psychological conditions of such growth. Utopian harmony is only monotonous. In rebuttal, utopian writers and their sympathizers are proud to confine their imagination to the realm of the largest happiness. Within that realm, utopians say, much more human excellence is possible than many people commonly think. That would be proven, if only the world, or a part of it, could be transformed or would become more permissive. Without subscribing to any set of specific utopian ideas, one can appreciate — at least to a moderate extent — the efforts of utopian writers to rescue this sentiment from the disparagement of those who believe, explicitly or not, that pain not only will but should remain, if not definitive of the human condition, then its substratum.

[ 1 ] The term gained widespread usage following the publication of Thomas More \\\'s 1516 book Utopia . [ 2 ] Building upon the work of sociologist Ruth Levitas , [ 1 ] social psychologists have tested the functions of utopian thinking among people. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Utopia is fundamentally a cultural and psychological concept, existing solely as symbols within people\\\'s minds. [ 4 ] Empirical evidence supports the connections between utopian thinking and the three primary functions proposed by Levitas: criticism, change, and compensation. [ 2 ] Theoretical models have been developed linking utopian thinking to established social psychological concepts such as collective action and system justification . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Theoretical background [ edit ] The term "utopia" gained widespread usage following the publication of Thomas More \\\'s book "Utopia" in 1516. [ 2 ] Nevertheless, the concept of an ideal society is evident in historical records predating the coining of the term. [ 7 ] Utopian visions are prevalent across diverse nations and communities, with content variations influenced by cultural differences. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] These utopian depictions have played pivotal roles in activism, art, political discourse, and philosophical texts. [ 5 ] Importantly, utopian imagery extends beyond specific domains, frequently surfacing in everyday conversations among ordinary individuals. [ 1 ] Extensive research has delved into the diversity and characteristics of utopian images within sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Researchers have founded the Society for Utopian Studies in 1975, which publishes the multidisciplinary peer-reviewed academic journal on this topic, Utopian Studies . Levitas postulated three primary functions of utopias, emphasizing that these idealized visions play various roles for individuals and society. [ 1 ] The first function is criticism, wherein the visualization of a utopian society highlights the deficiencies of the current societal structure. The act of contrasting the ideal with the present state of society provides a clear perspective on areas in need of improvement. The second function is change, serving as a motivating force that propels individuals to actively pursue the societal goals depicted in the utopian vision. Armed with a tangible image of a superior society, individuals can channel their efforts more effectively toward the abstract goal of societal improvement. [ citation needed ] The third function is compensation, which introduces a somewhat divergent aspect. Individuals may find satisfaction in their imaginative utopian dreams, potentially leading to a reluctance to pursue actual change in reality. The psychological satisfaction derived from the imagination can inadvertently serve as a deterrent to tangible action. In summary, while utopian thinking is theorized to play a pivotal role in inspiring social action, there is a potential risk of individuals engaging in hedonic escapism, withdrawing from the real world into the comfort of their imaginative ideals. [ citation needed ] Utopian thinking encompasses the mental act of envisioning an ideal society. [ 2 ] It is conceptualized as a form of collective self-regulation by Fernando and colleagues, extending the self-regulatory function of the ideal self to the collective action domain. [ 2 ] Self-discrepancy theory has unveiled that the ideal self\\\'s image can serve as motivation for regulating cognition, emotion, and behavior, driven by the desire to minimize the discrepancy between the ideal and actual self. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Just as the ideal self can motivate individuals to pursue goals aligned with that ideal self concept, the mental representation of an ideal society has the potential to collectively motivate people toward shared objectives embedded in utopian visions. [ 2 ] In fact, prominent social psychologists specializing in social change have contended that alternative societal visions hold power to motivate the conversion of societal structures. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The acknowledgment that the current societal configuration is not the sole possibility, coupled with the act of envisioning an alternative society with desired attributes, has been posited as a pivotal catalyst for social change, according to social identity theorists . [ 17 ] In order to empirically explore the association between utopian thinking and its psychological functions, Fernando and colleagues devised a Utopianism scale, conducted correlational studies, and executed experimental studies. [ 2 ] Individuals\\\' inherent tendencies toward engaging in utopian thinking were found to be connected to the criticism, change, and compensation functions. Those prompted to articulate "an ideal or best possible society which is hoped or wished for" exhibited heightened intentions to partake in citizenship behaviors compared to a control group, providing evidence for the correlation between utopian thinking and the change function. Those who depicted their utopian images also demonstrated reduced satisfaction with the current society, substantiating the postulated relationship between utopian thinking and the criticism function. However, the compensation function did not exhibit elevated levels in response to experimentally induced utopian thinking. The researchers posited that the connection between utopian thinking and the compensation function could be moderated by the perceived likelihood of success of collective action. This implies that individuals could lean more towards escapism when the prospect of societal change is perceived as low. Additionally, the researchers noted that the functions of utopian thinking, viewed as both an individual difference and a situational influence, might differ. Dispositional utopian thinking exhibited a stronger predictive link with change functions, while experimental utopian thinking did not predict compensation functions. In summary, a meta-analysis unveiled an overall positive impact of utopian thinking on criticism, change, and compensation, although the effect sizes varied across studies. [ 2 ] To comprehend the mechanisms underlying the impact of utopian thinking on its functions, one of the aforementioned experimental studies investigated the influence of the sequence in which individuals contemplated utopian societies and their current reality. [ 2 ] Oettingen\\\'s research on fantasy realization, [ 18 ] [ 19 ] which posits that mentally contrasting desired states with reality is instrumental in motivating goal-directed behavior, established that merely envisioning a fantasy is insufficient to stimulate goal-oriented actions. Instead, it is imperative to contrast the fantasy with the realities of the current situation, thereby engaging individuals in contemplating potential methods to achieve the envisioned outcome. Building on Oettingen\\\'s framework, Fernando and colleagues hypothesized and tested the notion that initiating utopian visions followed by a contrast with reality would be more effective in eliciting the functions of utopia, as opposed to initiating thoughts with the current reality and then introducing utopian ideals. [ 2 ] The research team found empirical support for the idea that contrasting the current society after contemplating utopia is more effective in eliciting criticism and change functions. In contrast, the reverse order of utopian thinking did not yield a significant effect compared to a control group that did not engage in utopian contemplation. [ citation needed ] Utopian thinking could be incorporated and add significant value to existing models that explain collective action . [ 6 ] The impact of utopian thinking extends to both conventionally conceptualized collective actions and more generic civic behaviors. [ 2 ] The former indicates participation in a social movement toward a shared goal with others, [ 20 ] while the latter refers to heightened engagement in society in any domain, whether or not in the company of like-minded individuals. [ 21 ] Utopias could be constructed around a certain group identity, such as a feminist utopia, or could generally inspire imagination of an alternative better version of society, without pertaining to a group membership. [ 2 ] The former will instill motivation for collective actions intended to achieve certain collective goals, for instance, achieving a feminist society. The latter will contribute to enhanced interest to be engaged with societal processes. [ citation needed ] The Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA), [ 20 ] a prominent collective action theory, posits group identity, injustice/anger, and moral conviction as primary motivators for participation. While group identification has been recognized as a pivotal motivator for collective action, utopian thinking introduces a pathway that can stimulate participation without necessitating a specific group affiliation. [ 6 ] Conceiving a cognitive alternative through thinking about utopias without belonging to a specific ingroup is found to enhance collective action intentions. [ 6 ] Furthermore, utopian thinking has the potential to instigate the formation of entirely new groups, thereby strengthening motivations for collective action through the tie of group identification and collective action as well. [ 6 ] Researchers have conceptualized what they term "opinion-based groups," where similar opinions are the basis of group identification. [ 22 ] Shared utopian visions could serve as the basis for new group formations. [ 6 ] Smith and colleagues have theorized that the perceiving disparity between the current state of affairs and the envisioned ideal could give rise to a novel identity, [ 23 ] which is highly relevant to the process of utopian thinking as well. [ 6 ] Overcome system justification [ edit ] In the inaugural empirical exploration of utopian thinking, it has consistently emerged that such thinking diminishes system justification . [ 2 ] Notably, Jost and colleagues underscored utopian thinking as a promising approach in their recent review of system justification. [ 24 ] Building upon this foundation, Badaan and colleagues have proposed a comprehensive framework that interlinks the study of utopian thinking, collective action, and system justification. [ 5 ] Within this model, two proposed mechanisms mediate the relationship between utopian thinking and the motivation for system justification: hope and abstraction . The first pathway is the affective route, wherein utopian thinking reduces system justification by fostering an increase in social hope. The second pathway is the cognitive-motivational route, wherein utopian thinking diminishes system justification by priming higher-level construal or abstraction. [ citation needed ] The authors highlight that hope, as an emotion, is nuanced and not merely a naive or optimistic outlook. [ 5 ] Hope transcends a positive expectation toward a goal; it inherently involves contemplating and implementing tangible methods to achieve that goal. [ 25 ] Understanding hope is pivotal in mobilizing social action towards change, as the absence of hope leaves no motivation for initiating and sustaining the often arduous efforts required to achieve the goal of social change. [ 26 ] Specifically, social hope pertains to the emotion an individual harbors for the future of society at large, extending beyond personal concerns. [ 10 ] The act of envisioning an ideal society through utopian thinking is proposed to have the capacity to evoke hope and instill the belief that the utopian dream is indeed attainable. [ 5 ] Mental abstraction emerges as a crucial pathway, enabling individuals to explore cognitive alternatives that may not be readily accessible in their daily concrete thought processes. [ 5 ] Abstraction proves effective in bringing distant goals, such as social change, closer to our cognitive forefront. [ 27 ] The greater the level of abstraction in imagining utopia, the more significant the impact in rendering cognitive alternatives accessible in our minds. [ 28 ] High-level construals, associated with abstract thinking, are also known to motivate self-control behaviors. [ 29 ] Applied in the context of social change, the abstract contemplation of an ideal society is likely to trigger self-control behaviors, prompting individuals to adopt strategies for fostering societal change. [ 5 ] To scrutinize these pathways, researchers manipulated utopian thinking by having participants read an article describing either a utopian society or the current society. [ 3 ] A structural equation model shed light on the relationships between variables. Utopian thinking increased both personal and social hope, subsequently elevating both system justification and collective action. The authors propose that this elevation might stem from the overlap in measures between hope and system justification, as certain items in the hope scale suggest that society is progressing in the right direction without major problems. Additionally, utopian thinking increased abstract thinking but exhibited only a marginal association with intentions for collective action. The authors elucidate that the measure for abstraction predominantly tapped into dispositional rather than situational aspects, making it less susceptible to change through utopian priming. [ citation needed ] Utopia and dystopia [ edit ] The antithesis to the concept of utopia is dystopia , representing a society that elicits fear and embodies the worst imaginable conditions. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Both utopian and dystopian visions share the commonality of existing solely within the realm of human imagination, diverging significantly from the realities of contemporary society. Utopian ideals serve as a motivational force for societal participation, guiding collective efforts toward the realization of an envisioned ideal society. [ 2 ] Dystopian thinking can similarly prompt societal engagement but in a manner distinct from utopian ideals. Dystopian societies, feared and avoided by individuals, stimulate preventive behaviors aimed at averting the realization of such nightmarish scenarios. [ 32 ] The functionality of dystopian thinking can also be elucidated through the framework of collective self-regulation. [ 4 ] The concept of "ought selves" propels individuals towards self-improvement driven by fear. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Analogously, dystopian visions motivate societal involvement with the goal of steering the societal structure away from the envisaged dystopian nightmare. [ 4 ] This engagement also aligns with the change and criticism functions proposed by Levitas within the framework of utopian thinking. [ 4 ] Moderating role of content [ edit ] Evidently, participants exhibit a diverse array of responses when prompted with utopian thinking scenarios. [ 6 ] Several studies have delved into the significance of these varied responses, aiming to discern whether specific utopian contents prove more effective in eliciting the functions of utopia compared to others. [ 6 ] [ 33 ] Fernando and colleagues contrasted two prototypical utopias: the Green utopia and the Sci-Fi utopia. [ 6 ] The former envisions a communal society dedicated to environmental protection and equitable resource sharing, while the latter portrays a society endowed with boundless resources, thanks to technological advancements. [ citation needed ] Upon priming with the Green utopia, individuals demonstrated a greater likelihood of expressing intentions for general societal participation. Conversely, the priming of Sci-Fi utopias did not yield a similar increase in societal engagement. The authors posit that societies perceived as fostering greater interpersonal warmth are more effective in motivating intentions for change. [ 34 ] It is important to note that this study focused on the impact of specific utopian priming on generic change intentions, and thus, it does not provide insights into the effect on behaviors within specific domains. [ citation needed ] Political orientation [ edit ] Despite employing the same prompt in empirical studies to induce utopian thinking across participants, the responses\\\' content exhibits variations influenced by an array of sociocultural factors. [ 4 ] Among these factors, political orientation stands out as a prominent determinant in shaping the contents of utopian imagination. [ 5 ] An examination of social media discourses, employing machine-learning methods, revealed that liberal and conservative users articulated different themes when envisioning ideal societies. [ 35 ] Nevertheless, there were overarching themes common to utopian visions across both political orientations. Both liberal and conservative perspectives consistently emphasized the value of family, community, economic prosperity, and the pursuit of health, happiness, and freedom. However, notable differences surfaced in the specific themes highlighted by each group. Liberals tended to prioritize themes such as social justice, global inequality, women\\\'s rights, racism, criminal justice, healthcare, poverty, progress, social change, personal growth, and environmental sustainability. In contrast, conservatives more frequently centered their discussions around themes related to religion, social order, business, capitalism, national symbols, immigration, and terrorism. In conclusion, both diverging and converging themes are found across political orientations. [ citation needed ] Cross-cultural development research method [ edit ] Development agencies, exemplified by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) , establish overarching development agendas that nations can collaboratively pursue. [ 36 ] To ensure the efficacy and cultural relevance of these agendas, it is crucial to formulate them in a manner that resonates with the unique local contexts of individual countries. Although the UNDP has made strides in enhancing cultural sensitivity over time, there has been criticism of some development goals for their lack of cultural nuance. [ 37 ] Badaan and Choucair (2023) propose the adoption of utopian thinking as a methodology for constructing contextualized development agendas. This approach involves soliciting input from people worldwide regarding the type of world they envision, analyzing these responses, and incorporating the findings into development agendas. By doing so, development agencies can comprehensively capture the diverse aspirations for change across nations, cultures, and communities. Qualitative methods such as interviews, focus group discussions, and open-ended surveys are particularly well-suited to leverage the utopian thinking framework. [ 37 ] An inherent advantage of the utopian thinking approach is its potential to actively engage individuals in the process of social change. [ 37 ] Through the act of envisioning and articulating the societal conditions they desire, people are more likely to contemplate and visualize the kind of environment in which they wish to reside. This process has been found to stimulate increased intentions for societal participation. [ 2 ] Furthermore, priming ‘Green utopia’ when asking about an utopian society has been demonstrated to catalyze broader social change intentions and behaviors. [ 6 ] This suggests that utopian thinking can effectively draw attention to and raise awareness about critical social issues. [ 37 ] Another notable advantage is the potential for development agencies to gather accurate information about the cultural nuances of various countries and regions. [ 37 ] By directly consulting with individuals who will both shape and be impacted by these changes, agencies can construct goals that are attuned to the specific needs of different contexts. This approach facilitates the identification of both universal and culturally specific issues, enabling the development of more nuanced interventions that account for regional differences. [ 37 ] However, the implementation of the utopian thinking method raises realistic concerns. [ 37 ] Firstly, the content of utopian imaginations may vary drastically, with some proposals aiming to enhance societal well-being, while others may advocate exclusionary visions detrimental to certain groups of society. Striking a balance between upholding human rights principles and navigating contradictory views within cultures is imperative. [ 37 ] Besides, qualitative data collection from a diverse population demands more time and resources compared to alternative methods, necessitating a consideration of the tradeoff between efficiency and cultural sensitivity.

[ou-topos = not-place] The etymology of this word which literally translates to a place that doesn’t exist, is representative of an idealistic stream of thought, something utopian socialists platformed in the early 19 th century. Utopian Socialism, although not an established and homogenous school of thought, refers to the ideas of Welsh manufacturer and social reformer Robert Owen and French philosophers Henri de Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier. A reaction to the prevailing economic system which prioritised private interests at the expense of the working class, Utopian socialism denoted the belief that society can and must voluntarily transition away from capitalism into a society run by co-operation and harmony. Emerging at an early stage of Capitalist development, Utopian socialists witnessed the consequences of unregulated economic growth and shared a sense of outrage at the suffering and waste produced by early capitalism. This also explains the ambiguity surrounding ‘Utopian Socialist’ theory for the anti-capitalist rhetoric was first articulated in great detail by Marx, Engels, and other socialist thinkers. The French and Industrial Revolutions which they had witnessed, produced a breakdown of traditional values and community bonds, causing individual detachment from work. Thinkers like Fourier noticed society was becoming increasingly hostile, fragmented and individualistic. Utopian socialism thus emerged as an idea in response to this detachment, what Marx later called ‘Alienation.’ Utopian Socialists attributed societal evil to Egoism which followers of Saint-Simon called, “the deepest wound of modern society.” These notions and observations helped cement anti-capitalist thought and set the foundation for the development of modern socialist doctrines. Utopian socialists failed to provide articulate critical analyses for the social conditions they disagreed with, but their ideals and aims are clear. Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Owen sought to set up communities which were ruled by principles of justice, benevolence, and cooperation. Characteristic features of Utopian Socialism Ethical Reform- The utopia that these socialists aimed to create were ethically homogenous communities based on values of harmony, association and co-operation. The ideas proposed by Utopian socialists were ethical in nature, as opposed to scientific or even economic. These thinkers strongly believed that a clear conscience and good morals could transcend class warfare and allow owners and workers to live and work communally. Voluntary transformations- Utopian socialists came of age in an era characterised by optimistic perspectives, hope and a romantic faith in unbounded progress. Social perfectibility, can thus be found at the crux of all their theories. They believed in peaceful transformations of society and that Industrialists/ capitalists would voluntarily reconfigure the system and share it with the working class. Science + Religion: A striking feature of Utopian Socialist thought was that, although these thinkers presented their work as the articulation of a truly objective understanding of the laws of human nature and industrial society, they also seemed to adopt a religious tone. These laws of human nature were also the laws of God and hence, their utopian science became an articulation of true religion. This allowed them to blend both science and religion, prophecy and sociology Utopian socialist Experiments Every Utopian Socialist managed to construct his utopia on a small scale. Some of these experiments include: Saint Simon The first Utopian Socialist experiment was carried out by the Saint-Simonians. These followers regarded Henri de Saint Simon as a prophet of this new world in which science and co-operation could create material change and propel the moral regeneration of humanity. In 1825, soon after his death, his followers started journals and organized lecture tours designed to elaborate and spread his ideas. By 1830 they had created a new religion that aimed at utilizing the productive forces of the emerging industrial society, to alleviate the ills imposed on the poor and consequently fill what they perceived to be as a religious and moral vacuum of their era. These societies were made illegal in France in 1830 but still sustained its influence worldwide till 1848, boasting more than 40,000 adherents. According to Keith Taylor, in his book ‘Political Ideas of the Utopian Socialists’: the saint Simonian movement was experiencing internal turmoil over moral and religious questions. The rejection of Christianity and desire to create a new religion with new moral and social codes including a more liberal approach towards sexual relations and marriage, did not reflect mass opinion. He adds that towards the end of the 1830’s the movement began to tilt towards authoritarianism with Prosper Enfantin declaring himself ‘Supreme Father’, banishing ‘heretics and advocating a ‘rehabilitation of the flesh’ Robert Owen: Robert Owen established seven communities in Britain between 1825 and 1847 and one in New Harmony, Indiana which was arguably the most successful. A cooperative society, this community boasted the first kindergarten, the first trade school, the first free library, and the first community-supported public school in the US. These societies comprised of between 500 and 1,500 people who would engage industrial and agricultural production. In the early 1830’s, the ‘Owenites’ engaged in labour organisation and made a large effort to create a national federation of trade unions. The Owenites predominantly spent their time attempting to create working-class communities in which property was collectively owned and socio-economic activity was organised in a cooperative manner. These societies succeeded for much of the 19 th century but not much is known about exactly why they failed. Charles Fourier Charles Fourier posited that most of the problems he observed arose from the dislocation between people’s passions and the manner in which society functioned. He believed that this conflict could be resolved with the establishment of these so-called phalanxes, or communes. Between 1841 and 1859, about 28 phalanxes were established in the United States. The relative success of Fourier’s experiments can be attributed to their small scale and anti-industrial outlook which provided refuge to agricultural workers and craftsman who were anxious about their employment in their rapidly industrializing society. Simultaneously, Fourier’s phalanxes were said to be badly led and organised, with Fourier expecting the charity of benevolent capitalists to help operate his schemes. As organisation began to improve, the phalanxes began to inch towards being a religious community centred around Fourier who was perceived as a messiah at this point. Keith Taylor states that splits in the Fourierist leadership can also be credited with the movement’s failure in France. These phalanxes in America however, began to thrive, they were considered to be libertarian and anti-authoritarian in outlook. The movement was in effect, so liberal that the French government tolerated it and allowed it to thrive without interruption, unlike the communities of the Saint-Simonians. Etienne Cabet Inspired by Thomas Mores utopia, Etienne Cabet wrote ‘Voyage to Icaria’ In 1839. Cabet’s Icaria called for perfect equality and was highly democratic in terms of the popular participation it entertained. This community attracted 100,000 to 200,000 thousand people, mainly working-class folk such as artisans who were insecure about their employment as industrial societies began to mechanise production. Icarian societies were established all over France, and one group set sail to America in 1848, where one community persevered until the end of the 19 th Century. Keith Taylor mentions that Icarianism’s founding ideas lacked coherence, stating that these communities did not survive increasing governmental persecution in the late 1840’s and that there were also failures of leadership.’ Critique Utopian Socialism was arguably platformed by Engels who introduced this concept by critiquing it in his 1880 book, ‘Socialism: Utopian and Scientific.’ Radical socialist thinkers ascribed the label ‘utopian’ to refer to the naivete of the theory, calling it fanciful and unrealistic. Making the case for socialism on moral grounds, several socialists dismissed the work of these utopian thinkers, on the basis of its failure to acknowledge the class struggle, liberation, and the analysis of actual material conditions. Due to the time in with these ideas were birthed, these theories were not able to critically analyze nor comment on the liberation of all oppressed groups. Slavery was still legal when Robert Owens established his utopian community in Indiana; the liberation of the working class, for them, was not extended to black people in the neighbouring farms. Several Saint-Simonites were also in favour of the French colonization of North Africa, neglecting both colonialism and imperialism from their analysis of poor social conditions caused by capitalism. Adopting an unrealistic and illusory approach, the optimism which streaks all utopian ideas was criticized heavily by emerging socialist thinkers. Utopian socialists believed that members of the ruling class could easily reconcile social conditions and ease the transition into a utopia, their theories neglect class struggle and actively advocate against seizing the means of production through revolution. Nonetheless, modern Socialist discourse lying at the intersection of idealistic and more pragmatic currents, appears so only because of the utopian characteristic of early socialist thought. This ideology provided a loose framework for revolutionary leaders and theorists to build off of, creating a comprehensive and elaborate articulation of what Socialism truly means.

More coupled the Greek words ou (no, or not) and topos (place) to invent a name that has since passed into nearly universal currency. Further verbal play shows the close relation between utopia and eutopia , which means "the good [or happy] place." Through the succeeding centuries this double aspect has marked the core of utopian literature, which has employed the imaginary to project the ideal. (This is not to deny that More\\\'s own attitude towards the ideal society he imagined may well have been ambivalent.) The words utopia and utopian, however, have been put to many uses besides the one suggested by More\\\'s book. Common to all uses is reference to either the imaginary or the ideal, or to both. But sometimes the words are used as terms of derision and sometimes with a vagueness that robs them of any genuine usefulness. For example, a proposal that is farfetched or implausible is often condemned as utopian, whether or not the proposal has any idealistic content. In another, closely related pejorative use, utopian designates that which is unacceptably different from the customary or is radical in its demands. The connotation of impossibility or complete impracticality serves to discredit a threatening idealism. Similarly, daydreams and fantasies — psychologically driven and frequently bizarre expressions of private ideals — are called utopian, as if utopia were synonymous with deviant or deranged thinking. Even when the word is used without hostility, its coverage is enormously wide. Almost any expression of idealism — a view of a better life, a statement of basic political commitments, a plea for major reform in one or another sector of social life — can earn for itself the title utopian. Furthermore, all literary depictions of imaginary societies are called utopian, even if they are actually dystopias (bad places) that represent some totalitarian or fiendish horror, or are primarily futuristic speculations about technical and scientific possibilities that have no important connection to any idealism. Much historical experience is reflected in this variety of usage. Indeed, the ways in which utopia (and utopian) are used can be symptomatic of prevailing attitudes towards social change in general. Nevertheless, clarity could be served if we see the core of utopianism as speculation, in whatever literary form, about ideal societies and ideal ways of life for whole populations, in which perfection, defined in accordance with common prepossessions and not merely personal predilections, is aimed at. Perfection is conceived of as harmony, the harmony of each person with himself or herself and with the rest of society. (If there must always be war, then utopian war is waged only against outsiders.) The tradition of utopian thought, in this core sense, is thus made up of elaborated ideas, images, and visions of social harmony. Not discussed in this entry is dystopian speculation in many genres about the near or distant future, in which the condition of human life is degraded or deformed. In many cases, dystopia shares with utopia a total vision of an imaginary society; but a deliberate hell, not a planned heaven. What brings such a condition into being is zeal to maintain the power of the ruling group, not the project of human well-being. An oppressive and tenacious dictatorship holds sway. The most famous example is the sadistic dystopia of George Orwell \\\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Inspiration of Utopianism The forerunners of the utopian tradition are the fables and myths of the golden age, the Garden of Eden , or some benign state of nature. These inherited stories, although of considerable antiquity, look back to some even more remote time in the misty past when harmony was allegedly the normal condition of life. Remorse or nostalgia is the usual accompaniment of these stories. Reality is not what it was, and worldly good sense holds that it is not likely that life will ever be again what it was — except perhaps through some divine intercession. An uncontrived harmony characterized the primal felicity. Simple people led lives as simple as themselves; because human nature was undeveloped, they were easily made content. If the glories and pleasures of civilization were missing, so were its artificialities, corruptions, and physical and psychological sufferings. Whenever disgust or disenchantment with civilization has become acute, these old stories are retold in order to expose the faults of civilization. But apart from their role in this fundamentally self-conscious method of striking at an existing order, these stories are primarily interesting as repositories of the age-old longings of ordinary humanity. All that the world is not is summed up in short and supposedly seductive descriptions. Sometime long ago, when people were still in touch with their uncontaminated nature, they lived without domination, irrational inequality, scarcity, brutalizing labor, warfare, and the tortures of conscience; they lived without disharmony in any form. The good life is, in the first instance, defined by the absence of these things. Although fondness for an early simplicity may seem regressive — an ignoble attachment to a primitive and subhuman harmony — a principal impetus for utopianism is undeniably to be found here. The later tradition not only fills out the picture that is only a sketch in the old myths, but more important, transcends the old myths. Whatever wistfulness for the golden age may be present, there is general agreement that primal harmony cannot be regained. The condition of harmony, which defines the good life, must be civilized. It may be more or less complex, more or less scientific, more or less abundant, more or less hierarchical, more or less free, but it must be organized and institutionally articulated (and almost always governed). Throughout the utopian tradition, reality is not defied to the extent of wishing away the idea of a settled society. In Plato\\\'s Republic , Socrates can dwell only briefly on the excellence of an amiably anarchic rusticity (no war, no class-strife, no politics, no meat-eating, no philosophy or sciences or high art) before his admirer Glaucon, with the stinging phrase "city of pigs," forces him to turn his thoughts to the ideal city (the city of justice, which is founded on the initial unjust act of taking land from others). This transition can be taken as typical of utopianism as a whole. Varieties of Utopianism Even with a scrupulous adherence to the definition of utopianism as the succession of ideas, images, and visions of social harmony, the relevant texts are extremely numerous. The main types of utopias include, first, and most properly utopian, descriptions of imaginary societies held to be perfect or much closer to perfection than any society in the real world. They are located in the past, present, or future and are contained in treatise, novel, story, or poem with varying degrees of detailed specification and imaginative inventiveness. The second type of utopia — closely allied to the first — is found in those works of political theory in which reflection on the fundamental questions of politics leads the theorist beyond politics to consider the social and cultural presuppositions of the ideal political order and the ends of life which that political order (placed in a certain social and cultural setting) can and should facilitate. Whereas the political theorist comes to the forms and purposes of all institutional life by way of political concerns and, as it were, incidentally, the intentionally utopian writer, with Thomas More as the model, works out from the start a comprehensive view of the ideal society and its way of life, a view in which political forms need not be of central importance. Some works of political theory — Plato\\\'s Republic , for example — so capably discuss nonpolitical matters that they fit into either category. Those philosophies of history that culminate in a vision of achieved perfection are a third cluster of writings that are not imaginary projections of the ideal but display instead metaphysical optimism of a total kind. These are the theories of inevitable progress created by such thinkers as the Marquis de Condorcet, Herbert Spencer , and Karl Marx . Marx, for one, indignantly fought against inclusion in the utopian tradition because he presented himself as an antiutopian realist blessed with unique insight into the nature of the historical process and its necessary workings carried even to the future, not as an idealist preaching to the world an ahistorical conception of the ideal. For all that, others have taken his writings as belonging in the utopian tradition. Roughly, the same holds for Spencer and some other philosophers of history. No list of the major sources of utopian literature would be acceptable without theorists of inevitable progress. Fourth are those works — sometimes called philosophical anthropologies — in which the writer attempts not only to isolate the instincts, traits, and capacities that are peculiar to humanity among all species in nature, but also to specify what is genuinely human rather than merely conventional, and what human growth and fuller realization would be. These discourses are not always consciously utopian; they may be directed to individual reformation or to preparation for the afterlife. Furthermore, the discussion may be carried on without reference to concrete social practices and institutions. That is, philosophical anthropologies aim to assess the various kinds of human activity, the various pleasures open to human beings, or the various styles of life made possible by advancing civilization or cumulatively progressive science. A few examples are Schiller\\\'s On the Aesthetic Education of Man (1795), Ernst Bloch \\\'s The Principle of Hope (1955 – 1959), Herbert Marcuse \\\'s Eros and Civilization (1955), and Norman O. Brown\\\'s Love\\\'s Body (1966). But despite the abstract quality of philosophical anthropology, and whatever the intentions of a given writer, it would be unduly constrictive to omit altogether this literature from an account of utopianism. When its idealism is manifest, philosophical anthropology is thus highly relevant to or allied with utopianism. In the fifth group are prophecies of profound alteration for the better in human existence made by religious groups, statements of purpose made by revolutionary groups, and blueprints offered by individuals, sects, and secular associations. Obviously, not all activist and reformist political and religious groups have sought to remake society completely, in conformity with the utopian aim of harmony. Nevertheless, many groups have not been satisfied merely to speculate about the ideal society but have sought to realize it, either by persuasion or violence. Examples are the sixteenth-century Anabaptist millenarian, or chiliastic, movements in Europe, radical Protestant groups in the English civil war in the middle of the seventeenth century, and some of the marginal radical figures in the French Revolution , such as Gracchus Babeuf. And in the nineteenth century, especially in the United States , small bands of eager people, religious or simply high-minded, formed utopian communities on unoccupied land, enclaves in isolation from the larger society. Some residues continued to exist after the nineteenth century. In the second half of the twentieth century, for example, a few communal utopian experiments in the United States were inspired by Walden Two (1948), the utopian novel by B. F. Skinner, a behavioral psychologist. Causes of Utopianism The literature of social harmony is thus extensive and diverse. Some periods and some cultures have been richer in utopianism than others. The question therefore arises as to why some persons become utopian in their thought or, more rarely, in their action. What causes the desire for change to be absolute, the character of idealism to be extreme and uncompromising, the passion for harmony so averse to the normal condition of dispute and dissonance? Several answers are found scattered in the history of utopianism; some indicate urgency, others do not. First, some intellectuals simply need to invent worlds. The construction of a utopia, even if only on paper, is a godlike act and resembles the creation of a fictional world by the nonutopian novelist. A utopia can thus be an effort at mastering the complexity of social phenomena; part of the effort consists of rearranging social phenomena to form a more rational or beautiful pattern. In short, one impulse that sustains utopianism, from Plato to the latest science fiction , is to give imagination free rein. This is serious intellectual playfulness. (The same could be said about philosophers of inevitable progress, howsoever they present their optimism.) Another cause is the desire for moral clarity. In the course of carrying one\\\'s demands on social reality as far as possible, one may achieve a fixed — potentially rigid — position in relation to that reality. As a consequence, reality can be constantly put to the test. To the utopian writer, improvisation that allows purposes to emerge from the onrush of experience or waits for new means to suggest or impose new ends is nothing more than a passive or complacent or naive immersion in reality or a confused and unprepared reception of it. Although utopian writers may do nothing to improve society, they may still deem it worthwhile to preserve the concept of the ideal. This may be thought desirable even in comparatively decent societies; to insist on the distinction between the acceptable and the ideal can have a chastening influence on those who govern as well as on those who happily go along. The utopian writer in all varieties of utopianism promotes dissatisfaction and self-criticism, with the risk, of course, of simultaneously provoking a reinvigorated defense of the status quo. A further cause of utopian thought — and one that lacks the quality of comparative detachment present in the two preceding ones — is the wish to subject society to a total indictment. What is involved here is not a sense that things could be, or may always be, much better than they are but that everything, or nearly everything, is intolerable — inhumanly oppressive — and deserves to go under. There is the direct, unappeasable indictment of established institutions, the way of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his discourses, William Blake in some of his long poems, Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto , or D. H. Lawrence in his two books on the unconscious. In works of this sort hatred of social reality may be stronger than love of any alternative; the positive utopianism may be only implicit. Other works propose, in contrast, that existing social conditions are a spurious utopia: the mass pleasures, whether technological or licentious, provided by affluent society block the way to a genuine transformation of the human condition into a genuine utopia. Such was the theme of the Frankfurt School of social critique in the middle third of the twentieth century. The indictment of society is indirect when the utopianism is explicit and the practices of the ideal society are sketched. And because the main aim is to indict, the practices of the ideal society are, at least in large part, the contradiction of those in existence. The utopian imagination in these instances is hemmed in by the grave defects of the real world; the urge is strong to replace them by conditions that in no way resemble them or to discredit them intellectually. Utopian writing so motivated may blend into radical satire aimed at the status quo and produce a work as great as Jonathan Swift \\\'s Gulliver\\\'s Travels (1726). Or it may produce works such as William Morris \\\'s News from Nowhere (1891) that are plainly archaistic and may expose themselves to the charge of immaturity or irrelevance. Almost all utopian works contain curiosities and excesses, which may often be explained as compensatory responses to especially terrible features of the real world. A similar cause of utopian thought is tactical. There are times when it may appear to those bent on reforming society that overstatement is necessary for some degree of success. That is, utopian works need not harbor utopian intentions or even an abstract utopian commitment. Although writers may lavish great energy on making their utopias plausible and attractive, they may aspire only to contribute to the gradual and partial amelioration of their societies. By painting fair pictures of felicity and suggesting that the world is, as presently made up, remote from that felicity, they may encourage an innovating spirit. At the same time, these utopias will give at least guidelines for reform. There may be no real expectation that the utopia will ever fully materialize or, indeed, that pure felicity can be had on any terms. Nevertheless, without that exaggeration, less-than-utopian reform would perhaps be too modest or too slow. Much depends on the persuasiveness of the writer\\\'s scheme. For that reason the utopias of reform tend to be less free in their speculation and are content to suggest the completion of certain good tendencies in the real world rather than trying to overturn it theoretically. Edward Bellamy \\\'s Looking Backward, 2000 – 1887 (1888) is an example of this tactic. The last cause of utopian thought is the most obvious — the conviction that the whole truth about human well-being in a setting of social harmony is known, can be imparted, and should be acted on. There is, of course, a wide variety in the historical situations that call forth such an overweening attitude. But if some radical Protestant groups (such as the German Anabaptists of the sixteenth century), some utopian movements of the nineteenth century (such as those inspired by the Comte de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier , and Robert Owen ), and those Marxists who are quasi-utopian are exemplary, there must be a sense of deep, intolerable wrong. There must also be a sense of enormous possibility, of not only righting the wrong but also going beyond to perfection itself, and either an overpowering group- or self-confidence or the conviction that the utopian leaders and their following are the instruments of some higher will or the culmination of some impersonal process. The word messianism perhaps best summarizes some manifestations of this utopian spirit. Uses of Utopianism Apart from their place in history, of what use are the works of utopianism? When utopian writings are deliberate constructions of whole societies, readers may think that utopianism is simply a scattering of uninhabited palaces — grand imaginary structures that may amuse realists if not filling them with contempt. But utopianism is more than its core, the deliberate constructions made by the imagination. The utopian aspiration is found in various modes of writing, and is sometimes oblique or even hidden. Is there, however, something of enduring value, in all these modes, even the deliberate constructions, apart from any question of application? There are, in fact, several benefits conferred by utopianism. As already noted, a cause of utopian writing is playful delight in the act of imagining new kinds of social reality. This delight can be answered by the pleasure the reader takes in the results of that playfulness. The standards for judging utopianism (in any of its modes) from this point of view are primarily aesthetic — plausible novelties in the projected way of life, clever and ingenious details, daring departures from customary practices. The inner coherence of the utopian ideal matters more than any closeness to probability, although naturally too much strain on belief weakens the pleasure. Admiration for the skill of the utopian writer may be mixed with appreciation for being allowed to contemplate what it would mean to live other lives. No stimulus to make one\\\'s own better need be felt. This may make the utopian enterprise somewhat precious, but it can be a source of guiltless satisfaction even to the most conservative temperaments. The utopian works of H. G. Wells are famous for their power to gratify the taste for sampling different worlds, however else they may instruct. A second use of utopianism is as a record of human aspiration. For the record to be complete, many other kinds of utterance must be consulted, but the various modes of utopianism supply a valuable indication. They are peculiarly vivid forms taken by changeable human longings underlain by permanent human wants. Read with due allowance for their often lopsided or eccentric quality, they will shed vivid light on their times. The desperation of a given historical period, together with the limits of its hopefulness, may emerge from a study of its utopian writings. The abundance or paucity of utopian writing is itself an aid to understanding a period. Third is the contribution of several modes of utopian literature to general sociology. The great constructed utopias — Plato\\\'s Republic and Laws , the relevant parts of Aristotle\\\'s Politics , More\\\'s Utopia , Tommaso Campanella \\\'s The City of the Sun (1623), Morelly\\\'s Code de la nature (1755), the writings of Saint-Simon and Fourier (early nineteenth century), H. G. Wells\\\'s A Modern Utopia (1905) — incorporate a great deal of sociological wisdom. Common to these and other utopias is the idea of the integration of social institutions in its most intense version, utopian harmony. To utopian writers no habit or practice seems innocent of significance for the proper maintenance of the utopian society. Utopian writers are therefore constantly pointing out connections between things that appear unrelated. Part of utopian analysis consists in the attempt to identify the major elements of society and to demonstrate how they act on one another and how each must be adjusted to the others if the best possible world is to be attained. For all their care, utopian writers commit a radical abstraction when they create their images of perfection, but this is the price paid by all general sociology, including that which is wholly neutral and descriptive. The last use of utopianism is moral. Utopian literature (including the literature relevant or allied to it) is a repository of reflection on human nature. Although not directly concerned to expose frailty, to scrutinize motives, and to astonish with cynical revelations, utopian literature has in it much hard psychological intelligence. Utopian writers disagree among themselves on the extent to which human nature is reformable, but rarely is this problem treated lightly. Indeed, it is usually acknowledged as the problem requiring the deepest study; it is also the source of the greatest hesitation. The principal mission of utopianism is to encourage the hope that human nature is changeable for the better beyond the limits assigned by worldly pessimism or theological despair. That the real world, despite its amazing pluralist variety, still does not exhaust the possibilities of human nature is the heart of utopianism. The long series of utopian texts enlarge the world by suggesting new character types and new social milieus in which these types could emerge. They also enlarge the world by their claim that the societies of the world ignore, repress, distort, or destroy human potentialities that have not yet been fulfilled. It is true that the concept of harmony rules out some segment of the spectrum of human nature. The essence of antiutopianism is the charge that any imaginable utopia, like any generous philosophical anthropology, actually impoverishes human nature by not allowing scope to those traits — wildness, excess, discontent, perversity, risk-taking, heroism — that threaten harmony. If therefore the precondition of a harmonious life is the thorough manageability of people, allegedly for their own good, human nature must suffer a terrible diminution. Such diminution is the awful hidden human sacrifice that utopianism exacts with a good conscience. What intensity of experience, what craving for more than satisfaction, what passion for the unknown and the unlimited, would be left? Humanity should always face difficulties that are impossible or nearly impossible to overcome. For many people, perhaps most, utopia can and does already appear in experiences and temporary conditions, in moments and episodes, in the world as it is. Each person\\\'s utopia is different from everyone else\\\'s. Utopia cannot be an uninterrupted and common way of life for a whole society. The only genuine utopia is actual life, and every proposed utopia is a dystopia. The critique of utopianism is without doubt a rich field and numbers Friedrich Nietzsche and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among its luminaries. A shrewd and witty antiutopian satire is Aldous Huxley\\\'s novel Brave New World (1932). A related antiutopian theme is that utopias are often driven by a strong passion for equality that threatens to efface all that is fine or rare in life or that can be created by or appeal to only a few. Utopias level society and thus work to make people more or less uniform and interchangeable; preaching individual expressive growth, utopias often destroy the social and psychological conditions of such growth. Utopian harmony is only monotonous. In rebuttal, utopian writers and their sympathizers are proud to confine their imagination to the realm of the largest happiness. Within that realm, utopians say, much more human excellence is possible than many people commonly think. That would be proven, if only the world, or a part of it, could be transformed or would become more permissive. Without subscribing to any set of specific utopian ideas, one can appreciate — at least to a moderate extent — the efforts of utopian writers to rescue this sentiment from the disparagement of those who believe, explicitly or not, that pain not only will but should remain, if not definitive of the human condition, then its substratum.

You must *interpret* the intent, especially if the edge annotation implies a deeper or more specific angle.\n        - For example, if the annotation indicates causal reasoning or a historical background is needed, reflect that in your query.\n\n        2. **Summary Generation**  \n        After receiving retrieved results, produce a concise but contextually appropriate summary that helps address the target sub-question.  \n        - The summary should match the *type of information* implied by the edge annotation.  \n        - Sometimes this may be a factual list, a comparison, a causal explanation, or a brief definition.  \n        - Avoid general or vague summaries; tailor the content to the sub-question\'s intent.\n\n        Be flexible: the edge annotation may imply different kinds of answers (e.g. factual, explanatory, evaluative), and your output should reflect that.\n\n        Use the available tools:\n        - `search(query, reason)`: to retrieve relevant information\n          Example:\n          ```json\n          {\n            "reason": "To answer the question about dark energy, I need to find out who discovered it.",\n            "query": "Who discovered dark energy?"\n          }\n           ```\n        - `summary(text)`: to return your synthesized summary\n          Example:\n          ```json\n          {\n            "summary": "Dark energy was discovered by astronomer Edwin Hubble in 1929."\n          }\n          ```\n        \n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "reason": {\n      "description": "The reason why this search is needed",\n      "title": "Reason",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "query": {\n      "description": "The search query string",\n      "title": "Query",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "reason",\n    "query"\n  ],\n  "title": "Search",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Root question: pros and cons of utopianism?\nParent question: pros and cons of utopianism?\nTarget sub-question: How have utopian societies been implemented historically?\nEdge annotation: Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons.'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}}

This perception is wrong. The word utopia was used in the title to a book written by Sir Thomas More which described an island nation and satirized the Catholic Church, Protestant theology, and lawyers (The full title of the book translated from Latin is A Truly Golden Little Book, No Less Beneficial Than Entertaining, of a Republic’s Best State, and of the New Island Utopia ). The word was formed from Greek and literally translated means no place. In modern usage the word utopia is generally considered to be a place which is better than any found in contemporary society and which is thus non-existent. Many efforts have been made in the past to create utopian communities, isolated from the contemporary society they were created to escape. Some have been created for the purpose of unfettered worship, others for the purpose of living in complete harmony with nature, still others to experience a completely egalitarian society. Many so-called hippie communes attempted to achieve a utopian society in the 1960s, nearly all of them were short lived. Besides the works of Plato and Sir Thomas More there is a long list of utopian society in literature, including Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels , Men Like Gods by H. G. Wells, and Andromeda , by Ivan Yefremov. The oldest known manuscript page of Plato’s Republic, where the first description of a perfect society is recorded. Wikipedia Here are the brief histories of ten utopian communities in the United States. Brook Farm, now a park, in Massachusetts. Wikimedia Brook Farm, Massachusetts The philosophy of transcendentalism began to develop in New England in the late 1820s, as an argument against the rise of both spiritualism and intellectualism. Its supporters believed that human beings are inherently good, and the trappings of society corrupted them. Transcendentalists believed that humans find their true selves through intuitive means, and reach their best when they are completely self-reliant. George Ripley, a Unitarian minister, and his wife Sophia embraced the philosophy and in 1841 established Brook Farm as a joint stock company about ten miles outside Boston in West Roxbury. In essence, the joint stock arrangement meant that participants in the community would share in the work as well as the profits generated by the farm. Each member would choose whatever work they wished, including women, and each member would be paid equally. Visitors to the farm paid a fee, which was added to the community funds from which everyone was paid. A school system established on the farm created income through outsiders’ attendance, but the farm itself was not profitable. By 1844 the members were operating under the socialism promoted by Charles Fourier and published a newspaper called The Harbinger promoting what they Fourierism . The members began the construction of an enormous community building called the Phalanstery, which would house all indoor activities for the community. It was destroyed by fire. Following the expense of building the Phalanstery and its destruction (it was uninsured) the community collapsed financially. It gradually shut down and was completely closed by 1847. One of the community’s founders was novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, who invested in the community despite not being a strict follower of their beliefs. Hawthorne used the experience as the basis for the novel The Blithedale Romance. The remaining buildings and property were taken over by the Lutheran Church, which used the property as an orphanage and school for well over a century. Many of the original buildings were eventually destroyed by fire. The farm is today operated as a historic site by Massachusetts.\'}, {\'title\': \'Doing Utopia: Radical utopian communities, mobility, and the body in ...\', \'url\': \'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/doing-utopia-radical-utopian-communities-mobility-and-the-body-in-the-early-twentieth-century/6CEEEFF2F3BF60CC636E7F133279546E\', \'content\': \'At the turn of the twentieth century, radical utopian communities emerged all around the world. They ranged from socio-political communes to religious sects, encompassing the political spectrum from the radical left to the extreme right. Many communities attempted to put theories of anarchism and socialism into practice. Religiously inspired groups combined—at times conflicting—political and cultural ideas to articulate and live a utopian model society. In African, Asian, Latin American, and Western countries, radical utopians built communities in spatially remote and sometimes also socially secluded colonies apart from the urbanizing metropoles and developing industrial centres. They often aimed at creating a self-governed, autarchic lifestyle based on collective agricultural labour. And they developed new concepts of an ideal society, practiced new ways of being, and established a base for sharing and propagating their ideas and accomplishments. Radical utopian communities served as retreat for activists, reformers, and revolutionaries as well as exiles, refugees, and hermits. Yet they simultaneously constituted laboratories for utopian practice and hubs for the meeting of people and the circulation of knowledge globally. Many community projects in the nineteenth and twentieth century have already been the subject of historical inquiry, but mostly within national frameworks. This article, however, places communal life as an integral part in the structural transformation, imagining, and making of the modern world. Footnote 1 Drawing on communal projects located around the world—the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, the Nōson Seinen Sha’s anarchist commune in imperial Japan, and the Rastafarian Pinnacle Commune on Jamaica—, this article highlights the global pervasiveness of radical utopian communities in the first half of the twentieth century. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach founded the Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg in 1910 and it soon became a site for political, spiritual, and nutritional experiments. As role model for Gandhi’s future ashrams , it was also a laboratory to develop and exercise a new subjectivity through ideals of co-operative labour, communal living in harmony and simplicity, and vegetarianism—ultimately, it was also a testing ground for anti-colonial resistance. Footnote 2 Anarchists of the Nōson Seinen Sha (Farming Village Youth Association), such as Miyazaki Akira and Suzuki Yasuyuki, built a village commune in Nagano prefecture in 1920s and 1930s imperial Japan. Their practical or ‘pure anarchism’ was aiming at an immediate implementation of an egalitarian system of production and consumption organized in farming villages as the foundation of social revolution encapsulating cooperative ownership, eliminated hierarchies, and grass-roots democratic models. Footnote 3 Finally, Leonard Howell, the ‘First Rasta’, founded the Pinnacle Commune in the hills of Saint Catherine’s parish in 1940 that attracted and fostered the Rastafarian community. Pinnacle was a centre for black millennial beliefs, religious revivalism, and political struggle against racism and colonial land ownership in Jamaica that promised the liberation of black peasants and workers. Footnote 4 This article deliberately puts seemingly disparate, non-Western communes into conversation. All cases were situated at the alleged margins of society, whether their liminality was self-imposed, due to repressive politics or discarded in historiography. Yet despite their social, political, cultural, economic, and spatial marginalization at the time, I argue that radical utopian communities were globally integrated into intellectual developments, social movements and their demands, and technological advancements worldwide. Moreover, from the communes’ and their members’ perspectives, their radical utopian projects were never peripheral nor nostalgic, but avantgarde. Hence, regardless of their marginal position facing the asymmetries of power created by capital, empire, and the state, an analysis of radical utopian communities helps historians to move beyond a dichotomous logic of centre/periphery to recognize these communities’ significance and impact. Rastafari’s close entwinement with Reggae, for instance, greatly affected Jamaican music and art that popularized Jamaica globally and still attracts followers and influences musical styles and social movements worldwide. Footnote 5 In imperial and contemporary Japan, anarchist thought shaped the literary scene, cultural production, perceptions of nature, and children’s imagination through anarchists’ readings and translations of authors as diverse as Leo Tolstoy, Petr Kropotkin, and Jean Henri Fabre. Footnote 6 And satyagraha as specific form of non-violent resistance, which Gandhi developed during his sojourn at Tolstoy Farm in South Africa by appropriating parts of Hinduism and Sanskrit and combining them with Henry David Thoreau’s concept of civil disobedience, eventually had a considerable impact on bringing down British colonial rule in India, it influenced Martin Luther King in the Civil Rights Movement and is referenced by various contemporary protest movements. Footnote 7 Such appropriations, interplays, and effects, therefore, require a decentred global history approach. A history of radical utopian communities in the early twentieth century demonstrates that other histories were possible notwithstanding the multiple constraints and grand narratives of capital, empire, and (nation) state power. Approaching radical utopian communities with methods developed in global history and the history of everyday life in regard to doing utopia , this article opens up decentred global history perspectives on a particular historical moment in the making of the modern world by complementing comparative and entangled history with a slightly different approach. Footnote 8 Let me explain: Gandhi/Kallenbach, Miyazaki/Suziki and Howell, and all the other respective members of the three communes in South Africa, Japan, and Jamaica, never actually met. A comparison of the three cases would systematically illuminate their parallels and differences, either highlighting their general agreements or distinct characteristics. From a global intellectual history perspective, we could reconstruct the entangled discursive formation in which all three groups engaged with the same literature, ideas, and debates. Footnote 9 This article, however, explores a different venue that is less concerned with comparisons and connections than with juxtaposing the three similar communes at different times and places that were nevertheless grounded in the historic specificity of early twentieth-century capitalist modernity. Similarity does not imply sameness, nor does it dwell on difference. It rather acknowledges plurality without insisting on mutual understanding ( Verstehen ) but asks for tolerant accommodation ( Verständigung ), and, like non-normative comparative history, functions as a heuristic lens that is equally attentive to rupture and commonality. Footnote 10 Following these incentives, Doing Utopia stresses the similarity of radical utopian communities across cultural, national, and imperial boundaries. Despite being situated in their respective contexts, they nevertheless shared a similar communal form, which included pursuing agricultural farming, and they were usually located at some remote place in the countryside, which promised a self-sufficient and independent lifestyle. Conspicuously, a similar logic underlies what Juri Lotman has explicated in the semiotic structure of the semiosphere, which consists of a metropolitan centre with more or less stable meanings and peripheries at the sphere’s boundaries, an ‘area of accelerated semiotic processes, which always flow more actively on the periphery of cultural environments, seeking to affix them to the core structures, with a view of displacing them’. Footnote 11 Translating Lotman’s observation to communal experiments, this turns seemingly marginalized radical utopian communities into the most happening places, where new signification and new practices, ideas, and community flourished. Radical utopians lived and developed new practices and ideas of liberty and communal life that contributed to the making of the modern world. Radical utopian communities’ patterns of cross-border exchange in South Africa, Japan, Jamaica, as elsewhere, were manifestly entwined with capital, empire, and state power. Despite different forms and experiences, capitalism as well as imperial and colonial state power nevertheless structured the various forms of disenfranchisement, repression, and exploitation manifesting, among other places and things, in South African racial hierarchies, the persecution of leftist political groups in imperial Japan as well as the highly stratified plantation labour system in colonial Jamaica. Yet imperial infrastructures also framed the global channels of communication and room to manoeuvre of its dissidents—in imperial centres and colonial peripheries alike. Footnote 12 Anti-imperialists and anti-colonialists protested against imperial power and colonial rule with civil disobedience, published political pamphlets despite censorship, refrained from paying taxes, and organized to resist the landowning elites—always in exchange with peoples, ideas, and movements worldwide, and quite often also beyond their own locality. At the turn of the twentieth century, as Leela Gandhi has so eloquently demonstrated, anti-imperial thought and activism flourished in cosmopolitan intellectual circles, and its advocates envisioned ‘the promise of ideal community, a utopia order of things’ in the deconstruction of imperialism through solidarity and exchange with their friends and knowledge from the colonial periphery. Footnote 13 This article contributes to this scholarship by drawing attention to the marginalized, sometimes even silenced, yet nevertheless rich and integrated history of radicalism in the making of the modern world. The following section discusses various debates, definitions and interventions surrounding utopia and radicalism. It highlights the importance of doing utopia , the historical praxis in radical utopian communities, which is often overshadowed by the dominance of national, nationalist, and capitalist ideological narrative as well as precedence given to utopian discourse. Footnote 14 Two themes, namely mobility and the ideal of the reformed body, are particularly helpful to emphasize the everyday utopia in Transvaal, Nagano, St. Catherine Parish and beyond, but also to narrate—as well as to complicate—this global history of radical utopian communities in the early twentieth century. Radical utopian communities: Debates, definitions, and interventions Cultural, literary, and religious studies have highlighted the rich tradition and impact of utopian ideals, and have engaged with modern ideas of utopia, tracing its genealogy—particularly in the West—from Thomas More’s Utopia (1516) to dystopian scenarios in pop-cultural literature and film in the twenty-first century. Footnote 15 Utopian writing certainly can discursively open up horizons of possibilities, yet, unfortunately, the study of utopia often stops with the intellectual history of certain theorists of utopianism or imaginary narratives of utopia. Footnote 16 Hence, here I want to underscore the importance of thinking about utopian projects not in terms of narrative, but actual praxis in specific communities. Footnote 17 Extensive research examines single communal projects in England, Germany, Palestine, New Zealand, Switzerland, South Africa, and elsewhere. Footnote 18 Much historiography on Northern American cases have prioritized an earlier period from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Yet, taking their inhabitants and agendas in the United States much more seriously, this scholarship revealed that communal experimentation remains a viable, arguably even integral part of American life. Footnote 19 Increasingly, transnational perspectives have demonstrated, for instance, that communal experiments on both sides of the Atlantic were showcases for early nineteenth-century scientification in the production of knowledge about social organization and progressive reform plans, and how anarchists in the Western and non-Western world sought the commune as a critical form with which to revolutionize human life. Footnote 20 The search for an all-encompassing definition of utopia and utopian communities is unquestionably an important intellectual endeavour. Yet one issue with most definitions is a latent Eurocentrism that favours a Western tradition of utopia, but also sustains a lack of dialogue between or at least an analytical oversimplification in approaching utopian concepts and community projects across time and space. Footnote 21 Here, however, I would like to draw particular attention to the established and problematic notion that definitions of utopia and utopian communities maintain discursive precedence privileging utopian ideas and visions in contrast to human agency in utopian practice. Reverberating the old debate about the Greek terms non-place ( oυτοπία ) or perfect place ( ϵυτοπία ), prominent assessments of utopia thereby reproduce utopia as a perfect state—either nowhere or in the future—that limits human action to follow a pre-imagined script. Footnote 22 Ultimately, such understanding subordinates radical utopians’ adaptive creativity and ignores their Eigen-Sinn , radicalness, and the impact of contingent and at times inconsistent human agency. Footnote 23 I would like to suggest an approach which uses utopia as an analytical term to bring diverse radical utopian communities into conversation. In doing so, I am emphasizing utopian practice in radical utopian community building, which Dennis Hardy has already hinted at by stating that utopians have been ‘seeking change by doing’. Footnote 24 In similar terms, Tessa Morris-Suzuki has highlighted a ‘living politics’, for instance in the context of Japan’s New Villages founded in 1918, postulating that utopianism is a form of self-help and non-governmental politics with which people respond to what they perceive as a social and cultural crisis. Footnote 25 Building on these insights, I would like to further complicate this take on exercised utopianism and lived politics by arguing that radical utopians were not just responding to a crisis or to an idea, concept or vision of change. Rather, and within their everyday practice and experience: they were doing utopia . This is because, crucial to modern utopias is the insistence on recognizing the creative power of human beings who can build a better and emancipatory society in the mortal world. Footnote 26 The correlation of utopian ideas and practice hints toward non-static dimensions of the utopian encompassing possibilities of action and oscillating between conditions and critique of the present, visions of a better future, and the immediate experience and practice—doing utopia, intended or not. Footnote 27 Radical utopians’ in motion: Physical and intellectual global journeys One crucial aspect of all radical utopian communities was an idea of journeying. Studies on migration and diaspora as well as ritual pilgrimage have stressed the importance of movement to a far away and probably unknown place, an experience that would significantly strengthen community. Footnote 28 The Rastafarians even have their own term for such journeying—to ‘trod’—, signifying, as Monique Bedasse has put it, ‘to move within, between, and beyond the boundaries of any particular nation-state’. Footnote 29 Mobility constitutes a particular dynamic that fosters the visions, efforts, and willingness of individuals and groups to create a better place in a distant, allegedly empty, pure, and yet unexplored space. Yet, as with the Rastafarians’ trodding, radical utopia is not just waiting in the distance, but it talks back and shapes and is shaped by highly mobile radical utopians and their doing utopia. In the modern world of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, ‘fast ships, railroads, telegraph lines, inexpensive publications, and film all reached into hinterlands and erased distance’, writes Emily Rosenberg. Simultaneously, the globally integrated patterns of connection and connecting made differences more visible, and arguably even fostered an awareness of difference. Footnote 30 Radical utopian communities emerged in this ‘age of entanglement’, approximately between the turn of the century and the end of World War II. And they were drawn into what Kris Manjapra has called the global maelstrom of ‘the multiplication of boundaries and claims for difference,’ at a time when ‘the accelerated mutual implications and transnational feedback loops develop[ed] among discrepant national groups around the world […] despite their power differences’. Footnote 31 Radical utopians, whether in form of Rastafarian trodding, satyagrahian networking or Nōson Seinen Sha anarchist conceiting, actively used and contributed to the increased connectivity and accelerated mobility in the age of entanglement. Radical utopian communities constituted niches and hubs for people traveling and knowledge circulating across local, national, and imperial boundaries. They were nodal sites of solidarity—’affective communities’, to use Leela Gandhi’s words—where people could experiment with the ‘politics of friendship’. Footnote 32 They also distributed and appropriated knowledge through personal correspondences, the reception and translation of certain theoretical and literary writings, and the own production of newspapers, pamphlets, and postcards. Mobility—both physical and intellectual—was indispensable to build communities on the margins of global modernity, enabling radical utopians to navigate as ‘moving subjects’ within a world connected. Footnote 33 The journeys of Mohandas K. Gandhi were globally connecting and integrating as he travelled from the colonial periphery in Gujarat to study in the imperial metropole in London. While on route to become a barrister in 1891, many Indian students crawled the London pubs, but young Mohan toured the vegetarian restaurants and London’s theosophical circles, reading Henry Salt’s The Vegetarian and The Vegetarian Messenger and becoming an active member of the London Vegetarian Society. This was also a gateway allowing him to enter the Victorian middle-class as well as acquainting him with the writings of the likes of Tolstoy, Henry David Thoreau, Edward Carpenter, William Morris, and John Ruskin. Footnote 34 Imperial infrastructure and trans-colonial entanglements brought Gandhi to South Africa, when in 1893, Dada Abdulla, a Porbandar-born businessman in Durban, hired Gandhi to settle a lawsuit against the racist anti-Asiatic regulations in South Africa. Over his more than twenty-year long sojourn in South Africa, Gandhi became well integrated into South Africa’s Indian community, ran a lucrative law office in Johannesburg, and fought the racist and unequal legal treatment in the British Empire through defences in court, petitions to the colonial administration, publicity, and non-violent protest that became known as the satyagraha campaign. Footnote 35 Although his peers were predominantly the Indian community, Gandhi also bonded with several Europeans that became highly significant for his life, activism, and the building of Tolstoy Farm. Among them were Henry S. L. Polak and Hermann Kallenbach, a British and a German Jew, whom Gandhi met in Ziegler’s vegetarian restaurant in Johannesburg. Kallenbach, Gandhi’s closest companion and ‘soulmate’, was born in Neustadt, East Prussia in 1871, learned and studied carpentry, masonry, and architecture in Königsberg (Kaliningrad), Stuttgart, and Munich. In August 1896, he travelled to South Africa to join his uncle in Johannesburg. As Eli Sarid, daughter of Hermann’s niece Hanna Lazar, recalled in her biography on Hermann Kallenbach, ‘South Africa was meant to be the new home for the 25-years old Kallenbach, the land of his dreams as Baupionier [construction pioneer]’. Footnote 36 Unlike Gandhi, the white, middle-class Kallenbach had not travelled abroad to enjoy a good education in the imperial metropole; yet like Gandhi, imperial infrastructures also allowed him to move overseas and to seek fortune at the edge of the British Empire in colonial South Africa. Even before Tolstoy Farm, Kallenbach and Gandhi had lived together. In 1908, Gandhi moved in with Kallenbach in his Johannesburg apartment on Pine Road, where they tried simplistic living. In a letter to his brother Simon, Kallenbach described how they cut expenses down to £5 per person a month that would include rental, food, and clothing—’with the exception of fees towards study’. Footnote 37 A year later, they took their communal project a step further and lived in a tent at Mountain View for about a year, which Shimon Lev has described as a ‘two-men ashram’, and which laid the foundation for the Tolstoy Farm. On 30 May 1910, Kallenbach bought 1,100 acres of land, formerly known as the Roodepoort Farm 49, in Lawley near Johannesburg. As a European, he was legally entitled to buy and own land, unlike the South African ‘Asiatics’, and he subsequently offered the land to Gandhi and the satyagraha movement, as stated in the Indian Opinion , to be used as long as their ‘struggle with the Transvaal Government lasts’. Footnote 38 From Tolstoy Farm, Kallenbach established a direct correspondence with Leo Tolstoy, asking for the Count’s advice in communal living and informing him of their doings in South Africa. And at Tolstoy Farm, Gandhi developed satyagraha and turned the commune into the homebase of non-violent resistance, hosting its activists and their families as well as international guests including prominent protagonists of the Indian Independence Movement such as Gopal Krishna Gohkale. About thirty years younger than Gandhi and Kallenbach, Leonard Percival Howell was born in Maye Crawle, Jamaica on 16 June 1898. Footnote 39 His parents were free peasants, and Howell grew up roaming the forested hills of Clarendon Parish. Rumour has it that one day in 1912, at the age of fourteen, Leonard was sitting in a tree and accidently witnessed a manslaughter. Refusing to testify to the police, his father Charles decided it would be best to send his son away from Jamaica. Unlike Gandhi and Kallenbach, privileged to get a law degree in the imperial metropole and to build a business at the fringes of empire, Howell started his journey hidden on a banana boat, without the comfort of his family’s financial, social, and emotional support, yet with a lack of trust in the colonial authorities. We do not know many details about his world-spanning journeys, but steamships sailing along imperial infrastructures brought Howell to Panama, where he witnessed the building of the Panama Canal and its horrible working conditions, to Europe and Asia while serving a US Army colonel, and to Harlem in New York City, where he got acquainted with Marcus Garvey and the politics of the black nationalist, pan-Africanist Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Footnote 40 The coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 demarcated the beginning of the fulfilment of a biblical prophecy, Howell and the Rastafarians believed. Ethiopia stood in for the whole of Africa, as a place that promised black peasants and workers liberation from the exploitative forces of capitalist, plantation-based agricultural production, its class privileges, and racist hierarchies. It gained purchase particularly against the background of Jamaica’s long, rich yet unsuccessful history of first slave and later peasant and worker rebellions. Yet it was mainly Howell’s initiative to popularize the prophesy and the subsequent liberation of black Jamaicans by returning from Harlem in New York City to Jamaica in 1932 with pictures of Haile Selassie I, which he also sold as postcards in the streets of Kingston, preaching the divinity of the Emperor of Ethiopia. In April 1939, Howell bought land in St. Catherine’s parish not far from Spanish Town up on Sligoville Road, and from 1940 there the Rastafarians would find their Promised Land in the Pinnacle Commune. As Hélèn Lee has described the Pinnacle grounds at the time of the Rastafarians’ first arrival, ‘The land seemed totally barren. There were no huts, and only a trickle of water’. Yet, the Rastafarians’ ‘were thrilled. No more taxes. No land tenure. No police. No crooked politician. No hateful neighbors to su-su pon you!’ Footnote 41 Howell’s Rastafarian Afrocentricity was a novel combination of ideas, which he synthesized with established Jamaican experiences of black revivalism and labour and peasant rebellions against racism, slavery, and colonial landownership, including the role of Ethiopia in the history of Africa and in the future of Africans in the diaspora. Footnote 42 Hence, existing belief systems, past and prevailing asymmetries of power and exploitation, established experiences with resistance, unfulfilled yet desired liberation, and the mobility with persistence and adaptive creativity of historical actors such as Howell constituted Rastafarian radical utopian practice. Journeying moulded doing utopia , embedded into imperial infrastructures and global capitalism, accelerated by early twentieth-century global mobility, which simultaneously fostered the very critique of and resistance against capital, empire, and state authority. The seaman Leonard Howell, I would argue, was inspired on his voyages between the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and the United States to build the Pinnacle Commune in Jamaica. In 1940, John Carradine, a journalist of Jamaica’s Daily Gleaner described Howell as a young and proud black man, who gathered ‘within his comparatively short life a wealth of experience…, which he has reaped first hand by travels which took him over a large section of the earth’. Indeed, Howell himself remarked that he had ‘traveled over a large section of the inhabited world, from Asia across Europe where [he] witnessed scenes of horror in such places as Austria, as the war just ended’. Footnote 43 Such high level of mobility also extended to Gandhi and Kallenbach, and for all of them the steamship indeed unfolded its rootless yet connecting force in the midst of the early twentieth century upheaval: it did not just bring two ‘endpoints in contact’ by crossing the sea, but it also enabled people to meet and reflect in transit, allowing them to experience a materialization and vision of passage and liberty. Footnote 44 Anarchists in imperial Japan, however, rarely travelled physically at all. Yet their intellectual journeying and experience of liberation nevertheless had a global, at times even universalist scope transcending borders and boundaries. Footnote 45 They eclectically read evolutionary theory, microbiology, and cosmology. They developed their understanding of radical utopianism in reference to Russian and French scholars dealing with mutual aid among prehistoric humans and animals, symbiotic microbe organisms, and a decentred universe. These became key references to scientifically prove anarchists’ conceptualization of cooperatist communalism without the need of hierarchy and (state) authority in social organization. Based on scientific knowledge anarchists considered cooperation and mutual aid—as opposed to exploitation and competition—as the engines of a distinctive modern temporality in historical progress and civilization. Footnote 46 As Nōson Seinen Sha’s Suzuki Yasuyuki pointed out, people living in social equality and universal harmony would be part of a worldwide, even cosmological struggle for liberation: It is deeply moving to carefully observe the entire landscape of the earth, its nature of infinite variety and the effect of human activities’ eternal force causing its harmony (…). Yet, the very same earth—sustaining and furthermore providing for humankind—and heaven—illuminating the world and supplying the universe’s energy—together with a matrix of human beings in harmoniously vibrating conditions can be seen and sensed. Footnote 47 Building on the understanding of a decentred universe and evolution of humankind that is based on harmony and cooperation, and not struggle or competition, the Nōson Seinen Sha were convinced that their 1930s anarchist farming village commune in the hinterland of Nagano prefecture was a first necessary step to aim for a never-ending cosmological dynamic preventing the establishment of hierarchies and exploitation. The Nōson Seinen Sha did not become famous for their extensive cosmopolitan adventures. When they travelled, they did only navigate within the confines of the Japanese empire. Hence, also for the Nōson Seinen Sha imperial infrastructures provided channels of mobility—and in particular those of communication—that allowed them to stay connected and informed although most of them were physically staying put. Moreover, their commune itself was situated at the fringes of the Japanese empire, located in the hinterland of Nagano prefecture. Although Nagano is towards the geographic centre of the Japanese archipelago, it was not at the core of Japan’s modernization and industrialization in the early twentieth century. Moreover, the Nōson Seinen Sha commune was in Tomigata, on a northern mountain spur of the Minami-Alps, slightly south of today’s city Ina, the former castle town Takatō, and therefore somewhat off the beaten tracks. Presumably, this choice of a remote location was deliberate as it was ‘keeping the state at a distance’, to use James Scott’s word. Footnote 48 In addition, yet equally speculative, some of the group’s members were born in Nagano prefecture, so they had local knowledge and presumably also local ties that could have made it easier to find a place to settle. Although the Nōson Seinen Sha appear to have been a rather male-dominated group, at least in terms of class background the group was not homogenous. The group’s two most prolific writers and theorists were Miyazaki Akira and Suzuki Yasuyuki. Miyazaki Akira was born in 1900 in Okayama but grew up in an industrial mining area in Fukuoka prefecture in northern Kyushu. After junior high school, around the time of the Russian Revolution, Miyazaki started working in the railway industry. It is supposed that he encountered anarchist ideas during a leave trip to Hokkaido reading Russian novelists, pursuing engineering studies at a college in Shanghai, and maintained contacts in a Nihon University student settlement in Tokyo. Positioned outside the privileged realms of academia and without a rich family background, working class Miyazaki was indeed an anarchist from below. His comrade Suzuki Yasuyuki, on the contrary, grew up in the typical intellectual circles as many contemporary revolutionary theorists and agitators did. Suzuki was born in what is now Kitaibaraki, Ibaraki prefecture in 1903, and went to school in Kamakura, where he became fascinated with Ōsugi Sakae’s interpretations of Christian socialism. In 1925, he entered Waseda University’s Department of Law and thereafter started very soon publishing on anarchist thought. Together with Yagi Akiko (1895-1983), Hoshino Junji (1906-96) and Mochizuki Jirō (1912-37), Miyazaki and Suzuki founded the Nōson Seinen Sha in February 1931 and started their communal experiment in Tomigata. Born in 1895, Yagi was the oldest member of the group, and apparently the only woman actively involved. She grew up in Nagano prefecture’s Kiso-district, and she met Miyazaki after she moved to Tokyo and started working for the daily newspaper Tōkyō Nichinichi Shinbun where she got attracted to Marxist and anarchist thought and activism. In 1927, Miyazaki got arrested for arson at the Hitachi Company, Yagi paid his bail, and apparently, they lived a ‘cohabitant life’ ( dōsei seikatsu ). Around that time, they met Hoshino Junji, who had been editing independent journals in Osaka from 1924, which also published some of Miyazaki’s writings. Mochizuki Jirō was the youngest founding member of the Nōson Seinen Sha. Born 1912 in Fuji in Shizuoka prefecture, Mochizuki accompanied his father to Tokyo, where he grew up in a working-class neighbourhood and loosely participated in socialist and anarchist union movements’ activities. There he studied Miyazaki and Suzuki’s writings, which appealed to him and apparently convinced him to join the group. Mochizuki was nineteen years old when they founded the Nōson Seinen Sha, and he died six years later in prison, allegedly due to sickness. Footnote 49 Mochizuki’s and others’ prison sentences followed a police raid of the Nōson Seinen Sha, who the national press had been scandalizing as terrorist cell within an empire-encompassing spy network—the immediate reason for the raid, however, was a military manoeuvre in the neighbouring prefecture Gunma, which the emperor was supposed to attend, and for which the police swept the area of all potential dissidents. Footnote 50 Anarchist group activities as well as study and publishing collectives brought members together and organize as the Nōson Seinen Sha. Yet some of their bonds also tightened through the shared experience of being demonized by the press, being harassed and getting arrested by the police, and spending time together in prison. The printing press, intellectual exchange, as well as the experience of modernity, here the forceful impact of capital, empire, and state power still fostered also the Nōson Seinen Sha’s doing utopia and their radical utopian community building. Footnote 51 As these brief biographical fragments indicate, these radical utopians in South Africa, Jamaica, and Japan were not the usual suspects of globally mobile historical actors, such as traveling elites, merchants, missionaries, agents of imperial states, and displaced migrant laborers. Rather, they were a new reform or even revolution-seeking, and globally conscious group of people from different social, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds. Of course, they were somewhat privileged and not ordered or forced to move—both physically and intellectually. Yet their adaptive creativity allowed them to use existing means of circulation, and they actively appropriated and moulded them according to their own needs. Despite the high level of global mobility and integration, ironically, radical utopians often despised modern technologies and repeatedly expressed their discontent with modernity’s supposedly corrupting impact. Mohandas K. Gandhi finished his book Hind Swaraj , subsequently translated into English as Indian Home Rule , on board a steamship traveling from London to South Africa. In his book Gandhi warns about the ‘evils of civilization’, encompassing modern law and medicine as well as railways and producing machinery. They would all expand apace—steam-propelled, as they were—, destroying ‘natural segregation’, spreading diseases and enslaving workers. ‘Railways accentuate the evil nature of man: Bad men fulfil their evil designs with greater rapidity. … Machinery is the chief symbol of modern civilization; it represents a great sin’. Footnote 52 At Tolstoy Farm itself Gandhi and Kallenbach attempted to reject modern machinery and put much effort in living self-sustained in austerity through co-operative farming, sandal-making, and cloth-sewing. Ideally, this could be accomplished in the countryside, because, as Gandhi foresaw: ‘Machinery is like a snake-hole which may contain from one to a hundred snakes. Where there is machinery there are large cities; and where there are large cities, there are tram-cars and railways; and there only does one see electric light. … I cannot recall a single good point in connection with machinery’. Footnote 53 Nevertheless, it was the steamship that had just brought him and his ideas from Europa to the very south of Africa, where his writings were first distributed in machine print in the self-produced newspaper Indian Opinion , and later produced as a book in the Gandhi-founded, South Africa-based International Printing Press in Phoenix, Natal from where printing machines and steamships, again, distributed his words, images, and actions worldwide. Footnote 54 Steamship travel also interrupted Gandhi and Kallenbach’s journey severely after Kallenbach got arrested on their way to India during transit in the UK, because he was carrying a German passport and was considered an enemy alien during the First World War. Footnote 55 Common in all cases of radical utopian community building was indeed a certain rejection of capitalist and industrial forms of production, consumption and living; yet they were closely entwined with modernity’s entailing mobility in the globalized world. They carved out their own spaces that were regardless of spatial and semiotic distances nevertheless inevitably linked to a broader social context. They oscillated between materialized and fantasized places, being simultaneously at the margin and the centre of modern society. Footnote 56 Radical utopians seem to have internalized this oscillation of rejecting modern life and simultaneously acting towards it in promoting and living alternative but no less modern lifestyles. Their constant engagement, exchange, and movement—their doing utopia—brought about border-crossing experiences and practices that fostered creative adaptivity and self- and world-improving strategies. And as I will discuss in the following section, the main target of radical utopians’ innovations and interventions was the human body—and with it all social formations. Radical utopians’ bodies: Practices of self- and world-improvement The body is kernel to human experience, interaction, and existence—and it was pivotal to doing utopia and the building of radical utopian communities. As Karl Marx wrote in the introduction to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right : ‘To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter. But, for man, the root is man himself’. Footnote 57 Marx’s emphasis on the materiality of human experience as well as humans’ capacity to make history, I argue, is an integral part of the otherwise often overemphasized discursive imaginary, the vision of utopia. Aware or more likely unaware, radical utopians followed Marx’s lead and evidently focused the human body and its habits, allegedly in need of fundamental, profound change, and they considered a reformed body the basis to reform themselves and society—and eventually humanity at large. Footnote 58 Administrators, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries of competing and conflicting political positions and scientific approaches worldwide, among them radical utopians of different couleur, considered the human body as the smallest unit in the larger social organization that would hence require meticulous attention, labour, and care for the functioning and well-being of social organisation. In different ways, Nōson Seinen Sha’s Suzuki Yasuyuki and British anarchist George Barrett, socialist and social hygienist Auguste Forel in Switzerland, sociologist Émile Durkheim in France, evolutionist Herbert Spencer in England, imperial Japan’s ideologues’ idea of kokutai (national body), and the Nazi’s vision of the Volksgemeinschaft , fostered an understanding of society as a complex social organism that forms a whole through the functionality of all social parts and being. Footnote 59 Anarchists’ notions of social organism of course departed from nationalist, imperialist, and fascist readings of the body in crucial ways. One fundamental difference was anarchists’ opposition to state and market institutions’ dictates to form any sort of unity by emphasizing people’s voluntary association in social organization for fostering everybody’s welfare. Footnote 60 For them, the material body needed food and other necessities, to which humans should have free access. Although there was much debate among different radical utopians about food’s and other necessities’ actual form and content—the proper ingredients, so to speak—they nevertheless practiced their radical utopianism similarly in autarchic village communes such as those in Nagano, St. Catherine, and in the Transvaal, concentrating on agricultural labour, production, and consumption as the basis for communal cooperation and being. Their shared concepts and practices of labour and living moreover emphasized the body and human agency not as limited to its functionality for the whole social body, but as pivotal to individual freedom in labour and association. The body also tied labour and liberty to issues of health and morale. Radical utopian critique addressed the exploitative desire of cost-effectiveness and profit maximization in making the human body more efficient and productive on cash crop plantations as well as at factory assembly lines. Peasants and workers often answered this with their bodies’ reluctance and stubbornness to function, including boycott, sabotage, strike, and insurrections. Footnote 61 Yet, bodies’ unsmooth functioning also resulted from the body’s potential to injury, sickness, and disability. State and non-state endeavours, particularly in public health, aimed for the maintenance of productivity as much as for fighting communicable disease, which nevertheless allowed increasing intervention into the most intimate spheres of human life. Footnote 62 This popularization of the body surpassed imperial and class boundaries, and to a certain extent also those of race and gender, and it was equally exercised and promoted in more established elitist circles as in alternative, counter-cultural milieus. For adepts of the life reform movement ( Lebensreform ) and nudist hiking organizations in imperial Germany, middle-class gymnastic clubs in the British Empire, and anarchist revolutionary educators, a healthy, fit, and morally superior body became the marker of civilization and progress. Footnote 63 Radical utopian communities and their members were no exception to these developments. On the contrary, they were exceedingly active and up-to-date in practicing, promoting, and producing ideals of the reformed body to withstand, as they believed, the forces of imperialism, global capitalism, and state authority. Living in austerity, maintaining a particular diet, consuming or abstaining from certain substances, celebrating certain forms of labour, embracing physical exercises and health practices, among other things, all underscore physical practices and bodily regimes as key elements of radical utopian communities. They were at the heart of radical utopians’ identifying—or rather: subjectifying—discourse and practices, and their favour of a modern and reshaped body, whose discipline in exercise, labour, food, and living allegedly promised equality, liberty, and progress for the individual and the world. A compelling example for the gravity of the body in radical utopian communities are what Gandhi and Kallenbach have called their ‘experiments’ at Tolstoy Farm in South Africa. These experiments with body and health encompassed vegetarian diet as well as the abstention from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, which was mandatory on the Farm. They included sports and physical culture into their daily agenda, and they considered fasting a key practice for both healing and as a strategy of resistance. Footnote 64 Kallenbach, himself a gymnast and bodybuilder who had been trained by the world-touring strongman and physical culturist Eugene Sandow (with the birthname Friedrich Wilhelm Müller), enthusiastically exercised at the Farm and introduced practices of bodily fitness from the life reform movement to his fellow farmers in South Africa. Footnote 65 Walking in particular became a popular form of exercise at Tolstoy Farm, which Gandhi even considered to be the most natural and justifiable means of transportation in contrast to engine-driven mobility with automobiles and trains. Gandhi, Kallenbach and other members of the Farm took great pains in covering the distance of over thirty-five kilometres on foot between the Farm’s premises and Johannesburg to run errands. Walking long distances saved travel expenses, but even more importantly, it advertised Tolstoy Farm’s satyagraha practice to the local community and the outside world. Moreover, walking in the Transvaal was an essential training for protest marches that the Gandhi-led non-violent resistance and non-cooperation movement applied in South Africa and India, most prominently during the Salt March in 1930. Walking—physically and symbolically, quite similar to the Rastafarians’ trodding—thus bore high significant and signifying meaning, a bodily practice visualizing the practitioners’ movements in space, its appropriation, and the production of new social space. Footnote 66 All these bodily experiments, including walking, aimed at testing and stretching the limits—strengths and weaknesses—of the body, that would enable to live a life of simplicity and less need. This, in turn, makes the body independent from the forces of state and market as well as enduring the hardships of imprisonment, hunger strike, and protest. Simultaneously—and a prime example being Gandhi’s protest marches as well as staging his ascetic body during hunger strikes and at the spinning wheel—it allocates the body as a powerful image for radical utopian communities’ struggle for liberation that can and did circulate the world over and inspired people far beyond their respective locality. Abstinence and asceticism at Tolstoy Farm aimed at strengthening the body physically but also spiritually, building character as it were. This included refraining from the vices of alcohol and drugs, and also sexual desire. Gandhi was convinced of vice’s domino effect, believing that, for example, drinking alcohol is directly linked to addiction, greed, and loss of self-control, because it can inevitably lead to gambling, debauchery, prostitution, and venereal disease. Footnote 67 In Key to Health , written after his experiences in South Africa, putting alcohol consumption and opium smoking on the same level of alleged unproductive uselessness, Gandhi sums up his anti-vice conviction arguing that, ‘Under the effect of alcohol a person becomes a rowdy, whereas opium makes the addict dull and lazy. He becomes even drowsy and incapable of doing anything useful’. Footnote 68 Yet Gandhi had already developed a similar reasoning on vicious temptations and the body’s vulnerability during his sojourn at Tolstoy Farm. In his 1910 published Hind Swaraj , or Indian Home Rule , a booklet in which Gandhi demanded self-rule and non-cooperation with the colonial regime, and a text that was also an important manual for communal living in the South African project, Gandhi writes: ‘Money renders a man helpless. The other thing which is equally harmful is sexual vice. Both are poison. A snake-bite is a lesser poison than these two, because the former merely destroys the body but the latter destroy body, mind, and soul’. Footnote 69 Gandhi’s experiments with sexuality included to compel even married couples at the Farm to refrain from sex, and to educate the children on the Farm in what he calls the ‘duty of self-restraint’: he sent girls and boys to group-bathing, always under his careful supervision allegedly to ensure no trespassing. He even took these experiments to an extreme, when, decades later, he lay at night with naked young girls to prove his strength to renounce any sort of sexual desire. Footnote 70 Gandhi’s rejection of alcohol, drugs, and illicit sex was part of his broader campaign against the imperial world order. As is well understood, Gandhi’s ideal of the liberation of India, tested and adjusted in the communal experiment in South Africa, was embedded into a global movement against imperialism and colonialism. Yet, lesser known are the similarities and overlaps regarding anti-vice activism, which Gandhi shared with social and moral reformers globally campaigning against alcohol, drugs, and prostitution. Footnote 71 They all toured on similar tracks and also shared intellectual journeys, developing similar forms of physical and spiritual exercise— doing utopia —to overcome vicious temptations. Combined physical and spiritual strength as traits of the human body to challenge the alleged evil forces of civilization, radical utopians across the world argued, would foster independence from imperialism and global capitalism. This world order, they contended, grounds in labour exploitation, racist hierarchies, and the alluring powers manifest in alcohol, gambling, and illicit sex—an unholy trinity the Rastafarians have called Babylon and thus corresponds to Gandhi’s understanding of vices’ domino effect. Moreover, the Rastafarians shared a global vision to challenge these alluring powers, since Rastafari was not only countering the Babylonian conditions in Jamaica, but by extension those of the whole, especially Western world. Footnote 72 Similar to Gandhi and Kallenbach, Rastafarians proclaimed that, ‘The forces of evil’, in Ennis Edmond’s words, ‘are not metaphysical entities, but human attitudes and activities that are out of touch with the divine, natural order’. Footnote 73 Various bodily practices, including the ritual use of cannabis, ritual chants and drums, vegetarian diet, and non-exploitative, collective agricultural labour, allowed Rastafarians to distance themselves from Babylon’s forces of evil. Footnote 74 At Pinnacle, land was at the Rastafarians’ disposal, free of the post-slavery plantation system, independent of landowners demanding royalty and without foremen giving commands. As news of the opening of Pinnacle for the Rastafarian community in 1940 spread, the first euphoria prompted people almost overnight to build huts and cultivate the land by planting corn, yam, and fruits. Others started to burn coal and sold it in the nearby villages; and still others started a tannery, and a shoemaker provided the Rastafarians with their ‘power shoes’—sandals made of rawhide and rubber from old tyres. Footnote 75 Agricultural production at Pinnacle aimed first and foremost at the community’s self-sufficiency. The commune’s members worked collectively, and everyone did his or her task according to their trait, trade, and training. The Rastafarians took pride in self-sufficiency, because working for themselves and the community meant independence and no backing down to any exploitative planter, crooked investor or any other (state) authority as their work would be the foundation of their own survival. This also took journalist John Carradine by surprise, who visited the Rastafarian community on a Sunday and expected to witness mystic rituals. Conversely, ‘It was in every wit like an ordinary working day’, he wrote in 1940, ‘men in the fields with cutlasses weeding, women looking after their household duties, shoemakers plying the awls, carpenters their tools’. Footnote 76 Indeed, contrary to established stereotypes at the time, the Rastafarians were not a religious sect but much more occupied with selling their surplus handicrafts, coal, and fruits and vegetables on the local market; apparently they also owned a bakery in Kingston. Their most popular agricultural product, however, was marijuana, or ganja in the Jamaican vernacular, which allowed the commune to gain massive income as the island’s largest producer of cannabis. Yet, this economic success brought also about the commune’s downfall as imperial anti-drug legislation was the pretext that enabled the colonial police to repeatedly raid and eventually destroy the Pinnacle Commune in 1958. Footnote 77 Similar to Gandhi and Kallenbach, the Rastafarians embraced the idea of natural living, which they similarly practiced in labour and eating. Food was to be self-produced and unprocessed, meaning without the “Babylonian” food processing machinery, which included products from cash-crop plantations and other trade-for-profit fruits and vegetables as from the hands of companies like United Fruits, as well as food refining and canning factories. Local, organic, and self-made were thus the key ingredients of Rastafarian food practices, which later became known as ‘Ital’. Footnote 78 Some Rastafarians have been practicing strict vegetarianism, others were and are following the Biblical food restrictions of the old Israelites. The Rastafarian term ‘Ital’ foods is already expressing this in its everyday practice, as ‘Ital’ is another Rastafarian neologism that has cut the ‘v’ from ‘vital’ and replaced it with the ‘I’ to emphasize and verbalize the ‘Jah’, short for Jehovah, which signifies the divine presence in all things and practices that matter to the Rastafarians, a divinity that equals being natural, pure, and here clean for bodily ingestion, and which is an integral part of the Rastafarian’s responsibility and everyday practice. Footnote 79 Japanese anarchists of the Nōson Seinen Sha equally emphasized the importance of food in their radical utopian community and the overall anarchist revolution, also in terms of purity and truth. Yet, this was not due to food’s divinity or one’s ascetic discipline, but because food and its equal distribution would ultimately determine emancipatory social organization. Illuminating is the Nōson Seinen Sha’s choice for the pseudonym Pan to Jiyūsha (Bread and Liberty Society), which the group used for several publications. The naming itself already bears a temporality that signifies priorities: first bread, then liberty. The premise for—and promise of—true liberation through social revolution, they argued, was rooted in the satisfaction of material human needs, which would take its most simple beginning in appeasing one’s hunger. Only afterwards the modes of production and complex social organization would take place. Footnote 80 This is most apparent in the anarchist analysis of food and its distribution by George Barrett in his Anarchist Revolution (1920), which Nōson Seinen Sha member Suzuki Yasuyuki translated into Japanese in 1930: Like an organism [sic!], [the] free society grows into being, from the simple unit up to the complex structure. The need for bread, hunger—or, in other words, the individual struggle to live, in its most simple and elementary form—is […] sufficient to set the whole complex social machinery in motion. Society is the result of the individual struggle for existence; it is not, as many suppose, opposed to it. Footnote 81 Along Barrett-cum-Suzuki’s line of argument, food (here: bread) turns into an ordering principle. This social organization, grounding in autarkic agricultural villages and small-scale industrial workshops, could do without and eventually dispend (state) authority, privilege, and unequal distribution of power. In order to initiate a decentralised and liberated society, the Nōson Seinen Sha argued, it would be necessary to put human needs and their satisfaction first and subordinate production and socio-economic control. The biggest hurdle to achieve a truly liberated society is any system of accumulating capital and state power, in which production and state rule determine people’s needs. In this regard, they operated with a terminology of purity and truth, based in scientific reasoning, as they claimed their anarcho-communist model of overcoming capital, empire, and state with a consumption-focused social re-organization as ‘pure anarchism’ ( junsei museifushugi ). Footnote 82 Their conception of purity and truth was inspired by Kropotkin’s idea of ‘mutual aid’— sōgo fujo in Japanese, which had universalist aspirations, because for the Nōson Seinen Sha the most important task was bringing about radical social change by implementing co-operatist communalism as part of a globally synchronic endeavour for the liberation of human life all over the world. Footnote 83 We do not know much about the actual daily life of the Nōson Seinen Sha’s radical utopian community project in imperial Japan’s hinterland of Nagano prefecture. Yet, the group’s members provided highly sophisticated elaborations of agriculture, work, and community. Miyazaki Akira even celebrated the farming village as the key site for social revolution. The three main tasks, he argued, are to live in autarchy, to possess only shared property, and to build communal welfare based on mutual aid. Less attentive to a vegetarian diet as well as alcohol and drugs, Japanese anarchists nevertheless saw similar dangers to the body, which they similarly emphasised in terms of labour, community, and nature. For their part, they saw the body endangered by corruption not so much by the evils of alcohol, drugs, and illicit sex, but by exploitation, profit, and money. Similar to Gandhi’s assessment of man’s helplessness and the Rastafarians’ disgust of Babylonian evil when it comes to the harmfulness of money, Nōson Seinen Sha member Miyazaki Akira declared that, ‘With the birth of money in society happiness vanishes’. Money, he argued, enables exploitation through profit and division of labour, and considered it therefore a force eroding solidarity, because it would divide people and nature, humans and their products, farmers and workers, cities and countryside. Self-sufficient farming within the village community and shared property, Miyazaki concluded, would contain the threat of money, and prevent the establishment of hierarchies. Footnote 84 Moreover, money—linking and enabling property and exploitation—also threatened individual freedom, social organization, and nature in another way. According to Japanese anarchists, rejecting money and, with it, capitalist modes of production, particularly in the industrial sector, also overcomes capitalism’s expansion and imperialism’s aggression. It would be a mistake to think that people’s participation in an imperial collaborating society ( kyōdō shakai ), contributing through labour and tax payment to a society that is nevertheless controlled by the imperial state, its institutions, and interests, would establish national unity and imperial strength to everyone’s benefit. On the contrary, Miyazaki argued, the government’s call for unity and security would be a distraction, and only the ruling class ( shihai gaikyū ) would benefit from people’s hard labour and tax payment. Ultimately, he even considered money, taxes, and capitalism to be the foundation for war and Japan’s imperial expansion in Asia since particularly modern industrial production is indispensable for modern war—and arguably vice versa. Footnote 85 The evils of money and profit-making are thus not only undermining and threatening the well-being of the individual and the social body through exploitation of labour power. Rather, money, profit and exploitation generate war—a condition that inevitably hurts the individual and social body. War, as has been underscored by Elaine Scarry, has its main purpose and outcome in injuring. Moreover, in war ‘the incontestable reality of the body—the body in pain, the body maimed, the body dead and hard to dispose—is separated from its source and conferred on an ideology or issue or instance of political authority impatient of, or deserted by, benign sources of substantiation’. Footnote 86 Japanese anarchists’ rejection of the vicious forces of money, profit, and exploitation—similarly grasped in Gandhi’s satyagraha as well as in the Rastafarian’s fight against Babylon—addressed war as the ultimate destructive force targeting the human body and human existence. Radical utopians’ only weapons against these forces of capitalism, imperialism, and modernity, they believed, were their untainted bodies, also as symbols of their pure existence and universal truth of their communal being. Conclusion: Complicating connectivity and the body Radical utopian communities and their efforts of doing utopia the world over were an integral part of the modern world and early twentieth-century global structural transformations across different cultural, national, and imperial locales. Despite all their differences, intriguingly similar, they built self-sufficient communes, pursued agricultural labour, journeyed the world physically and intellectually, and reformed the body as kernel to the human condition and all social relations. Navigating within and beyond the confines of imperial formations, they all articulated—and practiced—decided critiques against imperialism, capitalism, and state authority. To emphasize all these similarities, however, is not to uncover an ideal type of radical utopian communities. Rather, similarity underscores that even separated radical utopian communities developed similar visions, operated with analogous poetics, and addressed the same debates, and that they shared a global consciousness as they were convinced that their doing utopia would ultimately be making history. Footnote 87 However, bringing similar yet different radical utopian communities into conversation—in particular with a focus on mobility and the body—also requires complicating similarity and global connectivity. To begin with, modern mobility being a key aspect of radical utopian community building bares a certain irony: all radical utopian communities shared a critique against capitalism, imperialism, and state power, yet they were themselves constitutive to or at least part of it—at times one might even say complicit. Gandhi’s relationship with steam-powered machinery—simultaneously repulsive and supportive—is emblematic for this contradictory concurrence, as is his legal anti-colonial campaigns that were nevertheless embedded into the rule of law as the foundation of the British Empire. Footnote 88 Indeed, arguably the most pronounced, somewhat ironic, yet nevertheless historically specific characteristic of radical utopian communities was their experience of capitalist modernity that manifested in their very critique of capitalist modernity itself. Footnote 89 Furthermore, the existence of intriguing overlaps of methods and practices of self- and world-improvement across ideological divides still does not simply imply a more unified and standardized world. It even raises attention to the increasing diversification of the globalized world. Shalini Randeria has recognized this ambivalence, arguing that entangled or connected history is indeed narrating a ‘geteilte Geschichte’, which bares the double meaning of shared and divided . Footnote 90 Hence, it would be misleading to romanticize any revolutionary and emancipatory solidarity by ignoring the intimate encounter, the ‘tense and tender ties’ within radical utopian communities. Footnote 91 They were not free of hierarchies, and its participants also appropriated, negotiated, and failed to overcome boundaries of race, class, gender, and sexuality—despite a prevailing rhetoric of liberation. Gandhi was exceedingly racist and misogynist, complaining about the allegedly ‘lazy Black laborers’ and ordered women ‘to be chaste’ while he himself engaged in homo-erotic experiments with Herman Kallenbach. Among Japanese anarchists, race and gender as analytical categories for criticising asymmetries of power were most conspicuous through their absence as all the abstract rhetoric of a cosmological liberation and social organization in mutual aid never addressed issues such as racism and sexism. And Rastafarianism, despite being very attentive to the history of class, race and racial hierarchies, is over-patriarchal. Finally, one vivid yet also highly problematic attraction shared among all three communities was ‘nature’ and ‘natural living’ as reoccurring tropes in their doing utopia . These tropes expressed the desire and search for a supposedly authentic, just, and even life that would not have been deteriorated by the forces of global capitalism. Such desire, produced by the very same means of capitalist production that constantly produce global unevenness, as Siegfried Kracauer has illustrated contemporaneously, would open the gates to conservative and reactionary ideas and explanations of organic communal belonging, and potentially to fascism. Footnote 92 With their uncritical longing for nature, radical utopians, to various degrees, were also in danger of entering this slippery slope, which manifested in Rastafarian Ital food, Satyagrahian simplicity or anarchist rice-paddy-harmony that were part and parcel of radical utopian communities’ self-sufficient agricultural life as antithesis to capitalism, colonial rule, and the imperial state. Fortunately, they never got to the bottom of that slope. In sum, a close look at the everyday experiences and practices within radical utopian communities beyond the discursive demystifies the image of borderless cosmopolitan mobility, and also offers an important critique of the ideals of communal harmony. Footnote 93 Radical utopian ideals and interventions could liberate and undermine established social existence, but sometimes also affirm the allegedly clear-cut boundaries and hierarchies of modern society. Yet perspectives on and from the margins offer an ideal opportunity to analyse the range—and limits—of actors of globalization, the circulation of knowledge, and strategies of intervention. Investigating and connecting the different yet similar radical utopian communities and their doing utopia is one way, among many others, of exploring opportunities to narrate a decentred global history of the early twentieth century. And it ultimately demonstrates that alternative life worlds were not mere naïve dreams or failures, and not as marginalized after all, but actually accomplished: done utopias.\'}, {\'title\': \'Examples of Utopia: Types and Features of Ideal Societies\', \'url\': \'https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/examples-utopia-types-features\', \'content\': \'Have you ever pictured the perfect world through the words of your favorite novel? Then you\\\'ve thought about a utopia. This word actually came from literature when Sir Thomas More used the word utopia to describe the perfect island. Get a clear idea of what a utopia is and see several utopia examples. When you think of the perfect world, you might think of heaven or a world with no wars. Several writers and philosophers have tried to imagine the perfect world. But by definition, the term utopia refers to an ideal or place in which all aspects are perfect or nearly so. So, where did utopia come from? Sir Thomas More created the concept name in 1516 as the title of his book, Utopia . Within his book, More created a fictional description of an island that had the qualities of perfection. Since then, many writers and philosophers have tried to create a utopian society. However, most fictional utopias actually turn out to be a dystopia, an imaginary world with suffering and injustice. A prime example of a utopia that\\\'s actually a dystopia is seen in George Orwell\\\'s 19 84 . You can also view a dystopia in Aldous Huxley\\\'s Brave New World . Examples of utopia, in various contexts, as represented through literature, art, popular culture, and other means include: The Garden of Eden, an aesthetically pleasing place in which there was "no knowledge of good and evil" Heaven, a religious supernatural place where God, angels and human souls live in harmony Shangri-La, in James Hilton\\\'s Lost Horizon, a mystical harmonious valley Tao Yuanming\\\'s The Peach Blossom Spring, which describes a beautiful secluded community not affected by the rest of the world Ellis\\\'s description in Specimens of Early English Poets of the Land of Cockaigne , a place where "houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry" The entire Golden A ge as described by Hesiod, a Greek poet The Federation in the Star Trek series The Capital in The Hunger Games series, a place of luxury and freedoms England in Aldous Huxley\\\'s Brave New World , a place with no wars or hunger but also no emotion The term utopia was originally a description of a social environment and has manifested in many ways. The idea of "world peace" is considered utopian in nature, and United States communes were attempts at utopian ways of living. However, there are several different features of an ideal society. In an ecological utopia, the society would work in harmony with the nature around them. Rather than producing waste and pollution, people would become one with nature to have ecological harmony. Utopian idealism took off after the 18th century. Those seeking economic utopia are partially responsible for the development of commercialism and capitalism, although they were combined with some socialist characteristics in the early 19th century. Much of the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was working toward a self-sustaining utopian economy. Religious utopias exist in concept, both as intra-religious ideals as well as inter-religious. In these types of societies, faith controls every aspect of a person\\\'s life, creating religious harmony. For example, the Amish community works towards religious utopia. Scientific utopias pertain to the idea of perfection in terms of living standards. Means of attempting to achieve utopia through science include ideas that omit death and suffering from life or make the human condition perfect. Scientific and technological utopias are oftentimes connected. Technological utopian lifestyles would be those that replace human needs or functions with technology in such a way that humans have a higher quality of life. An example of a technology utopia is Francis Bacon\\\'s New Atlantis . You have seen many different examples of utopia, so it\\\'s easy to imagine your own utopia by thinking of your idea of the perfect society or the perfect world. Now that you’ve had a taste of utopia, check out examples of dystopia .\'}, {\'title\': \'Top 30 Examples of Utopia: Definition & Types - BitGlint\', \'url\': \'https://www.bitglint.com/examples-of-utopia-definition-types/\', \'content\': \'1.

This perception is wrong. The word utopia was used in the title to a book written by Sir Thomas More which described an island nation and satirized the Catholic Church, Protestant theology, and lawyers (The full title of the book translated from Latin is A Truly Golden Little Book, No Less Beneficial Than Entertaining, of a Republic’s Best State, and of the New Island Utopia ). The word was formed from Greek and literally translated means no place. In modern usage the word utopia is generally considered to be a place which is better than any found in contemporary society and which is thus non-existent. Many efforts have been made in the past to create utopian communities, isolated from the contemporary society they were created to escape. Some have been created for the purpose of unfettered worship, others for the purpose of living in complete harmony with nature, still others to experience a completely egalitarian society. Many so-called hippie communes attempted to achieve a utopian society in the 1960s, nearly all of them were short lived. Besides the works of Plato and Sir Thomas More there is a long list of utopian society in literature, including Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels , Men Like Gods by H. G. Wells, and Andromeda , by Ivan Yefremov. The oldest known manuscript page of Plato’s Republic, where the first description of a perfect society is recorded. Wikipedia Here are the brief histories of ten utopian communities in the United States. Brook Farm, now a park, in Massachusetts. Wikimedia Brook Farm, Massachusetts The philosophy of transcendentalism began to develop in New England in the late 1820s, as an argument against the rise of both spiritualism and intellectualism. Its supporters believed that human beings are inherently good, and the trappings of society corrupted them. Transcendentalists believed that humans find their true selves through intuitive means, and reach their best when they are completely self-reliant. George Ripley, a Unitarian minister, and his wife Sophia embraced the philosophy and in 1841 established Brook Farm as a joint stock company about ten miles outside Boston in West Roxbury. In essence, the joint stock arrangement meant that participants in the community would share in the work as well as the profits generated by the farm. Each member would choose whatever work they wished, including women, and each member would be paid equally. Visitors to the farm paid a fee, which was added to the community funds from which everyone was paid. A school system established on the farm created income through outsiders’ attendance, but the farm itself was not profitable. By 1844 the members were operating under the socialism promoted by Charles Fourier and published a newspaper called The Harbinger promoting what they Fourierism . The members began the construction of an enormous community building called the Phalanstery, which would house all indoor activities for the community. It was destroyed by fire. Following the expense of building the Phalanstery and its destruction (it was uninsured) the community collapsed financially. It gradually shut down and was completely closed by 1847. One of the community’s founders was novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, who invested in the community despite not being a strict follower of their beliefs. Hawthorne used the experience as the basis for the novel The Blithedale Romance. The remaining buildings and property were taken over by the Lutheran Church, which used the property as an orphanage and school for well over a century. Many of the original buildings were eventually destroyed by fire. The farm is today operated as a historic site by Massachusetts.\'}, {\'title\': \'Doing Utopia: Radical utopian communities, mobility, and the body in ...\', \'url\': \'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-global-history/article/doing-utopia-radical-utopian-communities-mobility-and-the-body-in-the-early-twentieth-century/6CEEEFF2F3BF60CC636E7F133279546E\', \'content\': \'At the turn of the twentieth century, radical utopian communities emerged all around the world. They ranged from socio-political communes to religious sects, encompassing the political spectrum from the radical left to the extreme right. Many communities attempted to put theories of anarchism and socialism into practice. Religiously inspired groups combined—at times conflicting—political and cultural ideas to articulate and live a utopian model society. In African, Asian, Latin American, and Western countries, radical utopians built communities in spatially remote and sometimes also socially secluded colonies apart from the urbanizing metropoles and developing industrial centres. They often aimed at creating a self-governed, autarchic lifestyle based on collective agricultural labour. And they developed new concepts of an ideal society, practiced new ways of being, and established a base for sharing and propagating their ideas and accomplishments. Radical utopian communities served as retreat for activists, reformers, and revolutionaries as well as exiles, refugees, and hermits. Yet they simultaneously constituted laboratories for utopian practice and hubs for the meeting of people and the circulation of knowledge globally. Many community projects in the nineteenth and twentieth century have already been the subject of historical inquiry, but mostly within national frameworks. This article, however, places communal life as an integral part in the structural transformation, imagining, and making of the modern world. Footnote 1 Drawing on communal projects located around the world—the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, the Nōson Seinen Sha’s anarchist commune in imperial Japan, and the Rastafarian Pinnacle Commune on Jamaica—, this article highlights the global pervasiveness of radical utopian communities in the first half of the twentieth century. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach founded the Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg in 1910 and it soon became a site for political, spiritual, and nutritional experiments. As role model for Gandhi’s future ashrams , it was also a laboratory to develop and exercise a new subjectivity through ideals of co-operative labour, communal living in harmony and simplicity, and vegetarianism—ultimately, it was also a testing ground for anti-colonial resistance. Footnote 2 Anarchists of the Nōson Seinen Sha (Farming Village Youth Association), such as Miyazaki Akira and Suzuki Yasuyuki, built a village commune in Nagano prefecture in 1920s and 1930s imperial Japan. Their practical or ‘pure anarchism’ was aiming at an immediate implementation of an egalitarian system of production and consumption organized in farming villages as the foundation of social revolution encapsulating cooperative ownership, eliminated hierarchies, and grass-roots democratic models. Footnote 3 Finally, Leonard Howell, the ‘First Rasta’, founded the Pinnacle Commune in the hills of Saint Catherine’s parish in 1940 that attracted and fostered the Rastafarian community. Pinnacle was a centre for black millennial beliefs, religious revivalism, and political struggle against racism and colonial land ownership in Jamaica that promised the liberation of black peasants and workers. Footnote 4 This article deliberately puts seemingly disparate, non-Western communes into conversation. All cases were situated at the alleged margins of society, whether their liminality was self-imposed, due to repressive politics or discarded in historiography. Yet despite their social, political, cultural, economic, and spatial marginalization at the time, I argue that radical utopian communities were globally integrated into intellectual developments, social movements and their demands, and technological advancements worldwide. Moreover, from the communes’ and their members’ perspectives, their radical utopian projects were never peripheral nor nostalgic, but avantgarde. Hence, regardless of their marginal position facing the asymmetries of power created by capital, empire, and the state, an analysis of radical utopian communities helps historians to move beyond a dichotomous logic of centre/periphery to recognize these communities’ significance and impact. Rastafari’s close entwinement with Reggae, for instance, greatly affected Jamaican music and art that popularized Jamaica globally and still attracts followers and influences musical styles and social movements worldwide. Footnote 5 In imperial and contemporary Japan, anarchist thought shaped the literary scene, cultural production, perceptions of nature, and children’s imagination through anarchists’ readings and translations of authors as diverse as Leo Tolstoy, Petr Kropotkin, and Jean Henri Fabre. Footnote 6 And satyagraha as specific form of non-violent resistance, which Gandhi developed during his sojourn at Tolstoy Farm in South Africa by appropriating parts of Hinduism and Sanskrit and combining them with Henry David Thoreau’s concept of civil disobedience, eventually had a considerable impact on bringing down British colonial rule in India, it influenced Martin Luther King in the Civil Rights Movement and is referenced by various contemporary protest movements. Footnote 7 Such appropriations, interplays, and effects, therefore, require a decentred global history approach. A history of radical utopian communities in the early twentieth century demonstrates that other histories were possible notwithstanding the multiple constraints and grand narratives of capital, empire, and (nation) state power. Approaching radical utopian communities with methods developed in global history and the history of everyday life in regard to doing utopia , this article opens up decentred global history perspectives on a particular historical moment in the making of the modern world by complementing comparative and entangled history with a slightly different approach. Footnote 8 Let me explain: Gandhi/Kallenbach, Miyazaki/Suziki and Howell, and all the other respective members of the three communes in South Africa, Japan, and Jamaica, never actually met. A comparison of the three cases would systematically illuminate their parallels and differences, either highlighting their general agreements or distinct characteristics. From a global intellectual history perspective, we could reconstruct the entangled discursive formation in which all three groups engaged with the same literature, ideas, and debates. Footnote 9 This article, however, explores a different venue that is less concerned with comparisons and connections than with juxtaposing the three similar communes at different times and places that were nevertheless grounded in the historic specificity of early twentieth-century capitalist modernity. Similarity does not imply sameness, nor does it dwell on difference. It rather acknowledges plurality without insisting on mutual understanding ( Verstehen ) but asks for tolerant accommodation ( Verständigung ), and, like non-normative comparative history, functions as a heuristic lens that is equally attentive to rupture and commonality. Footnote 10 Following these incentives, Doing Utopia stresses the similarity of radical utopian communities across cultural, national, and imperial boundaries. Despite being situated in their respective contexts, they nevertheless shared a similar communal form, which included pursuing agricultural farming, and they were usually located at some remote place in the countryside, which promised a self-sufficient and independent lifestyle. Conspicuously, a similar logic underlies what Juri Lotman has explicated in the semiotic structure of the semiosphere, which consists of a metropolitan centre with more or less stable meanings and peripheries at the sphere’s boundaries, an ‘area of accelerated semiotic processes, which always flow more actively on the periphery of cultural environments, seeking to affix them to the core structures, with a view of displacing them’. Footnote 11 Translating Lotman’s observation to communal experiments, this turns seemingly marginalized radical utopian communities into the most happening places, where new signification and new practices, ideas, and community flourished. Radical utopians lived and developed new practices and ideas of liberty and communal life that contributed to the making of the modern world. Radical utopian communities’ patterns of cross-border exchange in South Africa, Japan, Jamaica, as elsewhere, were manifestly entwined with capital, empire, and state power. Despite different forms and experiences, capitalism as well as imperial and colonial state power nevertheless structured the various forms of disenfranchisement, repression, and exploitation manifesting, among other places and things, in South African racial hierarchies, the persecution of leftist political groups in imperial Japan as well as the highly stratified plantation labour system in colonial Jamaica. Yet imperial infrastructures also framed the global channels of communication and room to manoeuvre of its dissidents—in imperial centres and colonial peripheries alike. Footnote 12 Anti-imperialists and anti-colonialists protested against imperial power and colonial rule with civil disobedience, published political pamphlets despite censorship, refrained from paying taxes, and organized to resist the landowning elites—always in exchange with peoples, ideas, and movements worldwide, and quite often also beyond their own locality. At the turn of the twentieth century, as Leela Gandhi has so eloquently demonstrated, anti-imperial thought and activism flourished in cosmopolitan intellectual circles, and its advocates envisioned ‘the promise of ideal community, a utopia order of things’ in the deconstruction of imperialism through solidarity and exchange with their friends and knowledge from the colonial periphery. Footnote 13 This article contributes to this scholarship by drawing attention to the marginalized, sometimes even silenced, yet nevertheless rich and integrated history of radicalism in the making of the modern world. The following section discusses various debates, definitions and interventions surrounding utopia and radicalism. It highlights the importance of doing utopia , the historical praxis in radical utopian communities, which is often overshadowed by the dominance of national, nationalist, and capitalist ideological narrative as well as precedence given to utopian discourse. Footnote 14 Two themes, namely mobility and the ideal of the reformed body, are particularly helpful to emphasize the everyday utopia in Transvaal, Nagano, St. Catherine Parish and beyond, but also to narrate—as well as to complicate—this global history of radical utopian communities in the early twentieth century. Radical utopian communities: Debates, definitions, and interventions Cultural, literary, and religious studies have highlighted the rich tradition and impact of utopian ideals, and have engaged with modern ideas of utopia, tracing its genealogy—particularly in the West—from Thomas More’s Utopia (1516) to dystopian scenarios in pop-cultural literature and film in the twenty-first century. Footnote 15 Utopian writing certainly can discursively open up horizons of possibilities, yet, unfortunately, the study of utopia often stops with the intellectual history of certain theorists of utopianism or imaginary narratives of utopia. Footnote 16 Hence, here I want to underscore the importance of thinking about utopian projects not in terms of narrative, but actual praxis in specific communities. Footnote 17 Extensive research examines single communal projects in England, Germany, Palestine, New Zealand, Switzerland, South Africa, and elsewhere. Footnote 18 Much historiography on Northern American cases have prioritized an earlier period from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Yet, taking their inhabitants and agendas in the United States much more seriously, this scholarship revealed that communal experimentation remains a viable, arguably even integral part of American life. Footnote 19 Increasingly, transnational perspectives have demonstrated, for instance, that communal experiments on both sides of the Atlantic were showcases for early nineteenth-century scientification in the production of knowledge about social organization and progressive reform plans, and how anarchists in the Western and non-Western world sought the commune as a critical form with which to revolutionize human life. Footnote 20 The search for an all-encompassing definition of utopia and utopian communities is unquestionably an important intellectual endeavour. Yet one issue with most definitions is a latent Eurocentrism that favours a Western tradition of utopia, but also sustains a lack of dialogue between or at least an analytical oversimplification in approaching utopian concepts and community projects across time and space. Footnote 21 Here, however, I would like to draw particular attention to the established and problematic notion that definitions of utopia and utopian communities maintain discursive precedence privileging utopian ideas and visions in contrast to human agency in utopian practice. Reverberating the old debate about the Greek terms non-place ( oυτοπία ) or perfect place ( ϵυτοπία ), prominent assessments of utopia thereby reproduce utopia as a perfect state—either nowhere or in the future—that limits human action to follow a pre-imagined script. Footnote 22 Ultimately, such understanding subordinates radical utopians’ adaptive creativity and ignores their Eigen-Sinn , radicalness, and the impact of contingent and at times inconsistent human agency. Footnote 23 I would like to suggest an approach which uses utopia as an analytical term to bring diverse radical utopian communities into conversation. In doing so, I am emphasizing utopian practice in radical utopian community building, which Dennis Hardy has already hinted at by stating that utopians have been ‘seeking change by doing’. Footnote 24 In similar terms, Tessa Morris-Suzuki has highlighted a ‘living politics’, for instance in the context of Japan’s New Villages founded in 1918, postulating that utopianism is a form of self-help and non-governmental politics with which people respond to what they perceive as a social and cultural crisis. Footnote 25 Building on these insights, I would like to further complicate this take on exercised utopianism and lived politics by arguing that radical utopians were not just responding to a crisis or to an idea, concept or vision of change. Rather, and within their everyday practice and experience: they were doing utopia . This is because, crucial to modern utopias is the insistence on recognizing the creative power of human beings who can build a better and emancipatory society in the mortal world. Footnote 26 The correlation of utopian ideas and practice hints toward non-static dimensions of the utopian encompassing possibilities of action and oscillating between conditions and critique of the present, visions of a better future, and the immediate experience and practice—doing utopia, intended or not. Footnote 27 Radical utopians’ in motion: Physical and intellectual global journeys One crucial aspect of all radical utopian communities was an idea of journeying. Studies on migration and diaspora as well as ritual pilgrimage have stressed the importance of movement to a far away and probably unknown place, an experience that would significantly strengthen community. Footnote 28 The Rastafarians even have their own term for such journeying—to ‘trod’—, signifying, as Monique Bedasse has put it, ‘to move within, between, and beyond the boundaries of any particular nation-state’. Footnote 29 Mobility constitutes a particular dynamic that fosters the visions, efforts, and willingness of individuals and groups to create a better place in a distant, allegedly empty, pure, and yet unexplored space. Yet, as with the Rastafarians’ trodding, radical utopia is not just waiting in the distance, but it talks back and shapes and is shaped by highly mobile radical utopians and their doing utopia. In the modern world of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, ‘fast ships, railroads, telegraph lines, inexpensive publications, and film all reached into hinterlands and erased distance’, writes Emily Rosenberg. Simultaneously, the globally integrated patterns of connection and connecting made differences more visible, and arguably even fostered an awareness of difference. Footnote 30 Radical utopian communities emerged in this ‘age of entanglement’, approximately between the turn of the century and the end of World War II. And they were drawn into what Kris Manjapra has called the global maelstrom of ‘the multiplication of boundaries and claims for difference,’ at a time when ‘the accelerated mutual implications and transnational feedback loops develop[ed] among discrepant national groups around the world […] despite their power differences’. Footnote 31 Radical utopians, whether in form of Rastafarian trodding, satyagrahian networking or Nōson Seinen Sha anarchist conceiting, actively used and contributed to the increased connectivity and accelerated mobility in the age of entanglement. Radical utopian communities constituted niches and hubs for people traveling and knowledge circulating across local, national, and imperial boundaries. They were nodal sites of solidarity—’affective communities’, to use Leela Gandhi’s words—where people could experiment with the ‘politics of friendship’. Footnote 32 They also distributed and appropriated knowledge through personal correspondences, the reception and translation of certain theoretical and literary writings, and the own production of newspapers, pamphlets, and postcards. Mobility—both physical and intellectual—was indispensable to build communities on the margins of global modernity, enabling radical utopians to navigate as ‘moving subjects’ within a world connected. Footnote 33 The journeys of Mohandas K. Gandhi were globally connecting and integrating as he travelled from the colonial periphery in Gujarat to study in the imperial metropole in London. While on route to become a barrister in 1891, many Indian students crawled the London pubs, but young Mohan toured the vegetarian restaurants and London’s theosophical circles, reading Henry Salt’s The Vegetarian and The Vegetarian Messenger and becoming an active member of the London Vegetarian Society. This was also a gateway allowing him to enter the Victorian middle-class as well as acquainting him with the writings of the likes of Tolstoy, Henry David Thoreau, Edward Carpenter, William Morris, and John Ruskin. Footnote 34 Imperial infrastructure and trans-colonial entanglements brought Gandhi to South Africa, when in 1893, Dada Abdulla, a Porbandar-born businessman in Durban, hired Gandhi to settle a lawsuit against the racist anti-Asiatic regulations in South Africa. Over his more than twenty-year long sojourn in South Africa, Gandhi became well integrated into South Africa’s Indian community, ran a lucrative law office in Johannesburg, and fought the racist and unequal legal treatment in the British Empire through defences in court, petitions to the colonial administration, publicity, and non-violent protest that became known as the satyagraha campaign. Footnote 35 Although his peers were predominantly the Indian community, Gandhi also bonded with several Europeans that became highly significant for his life, activism, and the building of Tolstoy Farm. Among them were Henry S. L. Polak and Hermann Kallenbach, a British and a German Jew, whom Gandhi met in Ziegler’s vegetarian restaurant in Johannesburg. Kallenbach, Gandhi’s closest companion and ‘soulmate’, was born in Neustadt, East Prussia in 1871, learned and studied carpentry, masonry, and architecture in Königsberg (Kaliningrad), Stuttgart, and Munich. In August 1896, he travelled to South Africa to join his uncle in Johannesburg. As Eli Sarid, daughter of Hermann’s niece Hanna Lazar, recalled in her biography on Hermann Kallenbach, ‘South Africa was meant to be the new home for the 25-years old Kallenbach, the land of his dreams as Baupionier [construction pioneer]’. Footnote 36 Unlike Gandhi, the white, middle-class Kallenbach had not travelled abroad to enjoy a good education in the imperial metropole; yet like Gandhi, imperial infrastructures also allowed him to move overseas and to seek fortune at the edge of the British Empire in colonial South Africa. Even before Tolstoy Farm, Kallenbach and Gandhi had lived together. In 1908, Gandhi moved in with Kallenbach in his Johannesburg apartment on Pine Road, where they tried simplistic living. In a letter to his brother Simon, Kallenbach described how they cut expenses down to £5 per person a month that would include rental, food, and clothing—’with the exception of fees towards study’. Footnote 37 A year later, they took their communal project a step further and lived in a tent at Mountain View for about a year, which Shimon Lev has described as a ‘two-men ashram’, and which laid the foundation for the Tolstoy Farm. On 30 May 1910, Kallenbach bought 1,100 acres of land, formerly known as the Roodepoort Farm 49, in Lawley near Johannesburg. As a European, he was legally entitled to buy and own land, unlike the South African ‘Asiatics’, and he subsequently offered the land to Gandhi and the satyagraha movement, as stated in the Indian Opinion , to be used as long as their ‘struggle with the Transvaal Government lasts’. Footnote 38 From Tolstoy Farm, Kallenbach established a direct correspondence with Leo Tolstoy, asking for the Count’s advice in communal living and informing him of their doings in South Africa. And at Tolstoy Farm, Gandhi developed satyagraha and turned the commune into the homebase of non-violent resistance, hosting its activists and their families as well as international guests including prominent protagonists of the Indian Independence Movement such as Gopal Krishna Gohkale. About thirty years younger than Gandhi and Kallenbach, Leonard Percival Howell was born in Maye Crawle, Jamaica on 16 June 1898. Footnote 39 His parents were free peasants, and Howell grew up roaming the forested hills of Clarendon Parish. Rumour has it that one day in 1912, at the age of fourteen, Leonard was sitting in a tree and accidently witnessed a manslaughter. Refusing to testify to the police, his father Charles decided it would be best to send his son away from Jamaica. Unlike Gandhi and Kallenbach, privileged to get a law degree in the imperial metropole and to build a business at the fringes of empire, Howell started his journey hidden on a banana boat, without the comfort of his family’s financial, social, and emotional support, yet with a lack of trust in the colonial authorities. We do not know many details about his world-spanning journeys, but steamships sailing along imperial infrastructures brought Howell to Panama, where he witnessed the building of the Panama Canal and its horrible working conditions, to Europe and Asia while serving a US Army colonel, and to Harlem in New York City, where he got acquainted with Marcus Garvey and the politics of the black nationalist, pan-Africanist Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Footnote 40 The coronation of Haile Selassie I as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 demarcated the beginning of the fulfilment of a biblical prophecy, Howell and the Rastafarians believed. Ethiopia stood in for the whole of Africa, as a place that promised black peasants and workers liberation from the exploitative forces of capitalist, plantation-based agricultural production, its class privileges, and racist hierarchies. It gained purchase particularly against the background of Jamaica’s long, rich yet unsuccessful history of first slave and later peasant and worker rebellions. Yet it was mainly Howell’s initiative to popularize the prophesy and the subsequent liberation of black Jamaicans by returning from Harlem in New York City to Jamaica in 1932 with pictures of Haile Selassie I, which he also sold as postcards in the streets of Kingston, preaching the divinity of the Emperor of Ethiopia. In April 1939, Howell bought land in St. Catherine’s parish not far from Spanish Town up on Sligoville Road, and from 1940 there the Rastafarians would find their Promised Land in the Pinnacle Commune. As Hélèn Lee has described the Pinnacle grounds at the time of the Rastafarians’ first arrival, ‘The land seemed totally barren. There were no huts, and only a trickle of water’. Yet, the Rastafarians’ ‘were thrilled. No more taxes. No land tenure. No police. No crooked politician. No hateful neighbors to su-su pon you!’ Footnote 41 Howell’s Rastafarian Afrocentricity was a novel combination of ideas, which he synthesized with established Jamaican experiences of black revivalism and labour and peasant rebellions against racism, slavery, and colonial landownership, including the role of Ethiopia in the history of Africa and in the future of Africans in the diaspora. Footnote 42 Hence, existing belief systems, past and prevailing asymmetries of power and exploitation, established experiences with resistance, unfulfilled yet desired liberation, and the mobility with persistence and adaptive creativity of historical actors such as Howell constituted Rastafarian radical utopian practice. Journeying moulded doing utopia , embedded into imperial infrastructures and global capitalism, accelerated by early twentieth-century global mobility, which simultaneously fostered the very critique of and resistance against capital, empire, and state authority. The seaman Leonard Howell, I would argue, was inspired on his voyages between the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and the United States to build the Pinnacle Commune in Jamaica. In 1940, John Carradine, a journalist of Jamaica’s Daily Gleaner described Howell as a young and proud black man, who gathered ‘within his comparatively short life a wealth of experience…, which he has reaped first hand by travels which took him over a large section of the earth’. Indeed, Howell himself remarked that he had ‘traveled over a large section of the inhabited world, from Asia across Europe where [he] witnessed scenes of horror in such places as Austria, as the war just ended’. Footnote 43 Such high level of mobility also extended to Gandhi and Kallenbach, and for all of them the steamship indeed unfolded its rootless yet connecting force in the midst of the early twentieth century upheaval: it did not just bring two ‘endpoints in contact’ by crossing the sea, but it also enabled people to meet and reflect in transit, allowing them to experience a materialization and vision of passage and liberty. Footnote 44 Anarchists in imperial Japan, however, rarely travelled physically at all. Yet their intellectual journeying and experience of liberation nevertheless had a global, at times even universalist scope transcending borders and boundaries. Footnote 45 They eclectically read evolutionary theory, microbiology, and cosmology. They developed their understanding of radical utopianism in reference to Russian and French scholars dealing with mutual aid among prehistoric humans and animals, symbiotic microbe organisms, and a decentred universe. These became key references to scientifically prove anarchists’ conceptualization of cooperatist communalism without the need of hierarchy and (state) authority in social organization. Based on scientific knowledge anarchists considered cooperation and mutual aid—as opposed to exploitation and competition—as the engines of a distinctive modern temporality in historical progress and civilization. Footnote 46 As Nōson Seinen Sha’s Suzuki Yasuyuki pointed out, people living in social equality and universal harmony would be part of a worldwide, even cosmological struggle for liberation: It is deeply moving to carefully observe the entire landscape of the earth, its nature of infinite variety and the effect of human activities’ eternal force causing its harmony (…). Yet, the very same earth—sustaining and furthermore providing for humankind—and heaven—illuminating the world and supplying the universe’s energy—together with a matrix of human beings in harmoniously vibrating conditions can be seen and sensed. Footnote 47 Building on the understanding of a decentred universe and evolution of humankind that is based on harmony and cooperation, and not struggle or competition, the Nōson Seinen Sha were convinced that their 1930s anarchist farming village commune in the hinterland of Nagano prefecture was a first necessary step to aim for a never-ending cosmological dynamic preventing the establishment of hierarchies and exploitation. The Nōson Seinen Sha did not become famous for their extensive cosmopolitan adventures. When they travelled, they did only navigate within the confines of the Japanese empire. Hence, also for the Nōson Seinen Sha imperial infrastructures provided channels of mobility—and in particular those of communication—that allowed them to stay connected and informed although most of them were physically staying put. Moreover, their commune itself was situated at the fringes of the Japanese empire, located in the hinterland of Nagano prefecture. Although Nagano is towards the geographic centre of the Japanese archipelago, it was not at the core of Japan’s modernization and industrialization in the early twentieth century. Moreover, the Nōson Seinen Sha commune was in Tomigata, on a northern mountain spur of the Minami-Alps, slightly south of today’s city Ina, the former castle town Takatō, and therefore somewhat off the beaten tracks. Presumably, this choice of a remote location was deliberate as it was ‘keeping the state at a distance’, to use James Scott’s word. Footnote 48 In addition, yet equally speculative, some of the group’s members were born in Nagano prefecture, so they had local knowledge and presumably also local ties that could have made it easier to find a place to settle. Although the Nōson Seinen Sha appear to have been a rather male-dominated group, at least in terms of class background the group was not homogenous. The group’s two most prolific writers and theorists were Miyazaki Akira and Suzuki Yasuyuki. Miyazaki Akira was born in 1900 in Okayama but grew up in an industrial mining area in Fukuoka prefecture in northern Kyushu. After junior high school, around the time of the Russian Revolution, Miyazaki started working in the railway industry. It is supposed that he encountered anarchist ideas during a leave trip to Hokkaido reading Russian novelists, pursuing engineering studies at a college in Shanghai, and maintained contacts in a Nihon University student settlement in Tokyo. Positioned outside the privileged realms of academia and without a rich family background, working class Miyazaki was indeed an anarchist from below. His comrade Suzuki Yasuyuki, on the contrary, grew up in the typical intellectual circles as many contemporary revolutionary theorists and agitators did. Suzuki was born in what is now Kitaibaraki, Ibaraki prefecture in 1903, and went to school in Kamakura, where he became fascinated with Ōsugi Sakae’s interpretations of Christian socialism. In 1925, he entered Waseda University’s Department of Law and thereafter started very soon publishing on anarchist thought. Together with Yagi Akiko (1895-1983), Hoshino Junji (1906-96) and Mochizuki Jirō (1912-37), Miyazaki and Suzuki founded the Nōson Seinen Sha in February 1931 and started their communal experiment in Tomigata. Born in 1895, Yagi was the oldest member of the group, and apparently the only woman actively involved. She grew up in Nagano prefecture’s Kiso-district, and she met Miyazaki after she moved to Tokyo and started working for the daily newspaper Tōkyō Nichinichi Shinbun where she got attracted to Marxist and anarchist thought and activism. In 1927, Miyazaki got arrested for arson at the Hitachi Company, Yagi paid his bail, and apparently, they lived a ‘cohabitant life’ ( dōsei seikatsu ). Around that time, they met Hoshino Junji, who had been editing independent journals in Osaka from 1924, which also published some of Miyazaki’s writings. Mochizuki Jirō was the youngest founding member of the Nōson Seinen Sha. Born 1912 in Fuji in Shizuoka prefecture, Mochizuki accompanied his father to Tokyo, where he grew up in a working-class neighbourhood and loosely participated in socialist and anarchist union movements’ activities. There he studied Miyazaki and Suzuki’s writings, which appealed to him and apparently convinced him to join the group. Mochizuki was nineteen years old when they founded the Nōson Seinen Sha, and he died six years later in prison, allegedly due to sickness. Footnote 49 Mochizuki’s and others’ prison sentences followed a police raid of the Nōson Seinen Sha, who the national press had been scandalizing as terrorist cell within an empire-encompassing spy network—the immediate reason for the raid, however, was a military manoeuvre in the neighbouring prefecture Gunma, which the emperor was supposed to attend, and for which the police swept the area of all potential dissidents. Footnote 50 Anarchist group activities as well as study and publishing collectives brought members together and organize as the Nōson Seinen Sha. Yet some of their bonds also tightened through the shared experience of being demonized by the press, being harassed and getting arrested by the police, and spending time together in prison. The printing press, intellectual exchange, as well as the experience of modernity, here the forceful impact of capital, empire, and state power still fostered also the Nōson Seinen Sha’s doing utopia and their radical utopian community building. Footnote 51 As these brief biographical fragments indicate, these radical utopians in South Africa, Jamaica, and Japan were not the usual suspects of globally mobile historical actors, such as traveling elites, merchants, missionaries, agents of imperial states, and displaced migrant laborers. Rather, they were a new reform or even revolution-seeking, and globally conscious group of people from different social, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds. Of course, they were somewhat privileged and not ordered or forced to move—both physically and intellectually. Yet their adaptive creativity allowed them to use existing means of circulation, and they actively appropriated and moulded them according to their own needs. Despite the high level of global mobility and integration, ironically, radical utopians often despised modern technologies and repeatedly expressed their discontent with modernity’s supposedly corrupting impact. Mohandas K. Gandhi finished his book Hind Swaraj , subsequently translated into English as Indian Home Rule , on board a steamship traveling from London to South Africa. In his book Gandhi warns about the ‘evils of civilization’, encompassing modern law and medicine as well as railways and producing machinery. They would all expand apace—steam-propelled, as they were—, destroying ‘natural segregation’, spreading diseases and enslaving workers. ‘Railways accentuate the evil nature of man: Bad men fulfil their evil designs with greater rapidity. … Machinery is the chief symbol of modern civilization; it represents a great sin’. Footnote 52 At Tolstoy Farm itself Gandhi and Kallenbach attempted to reject modern machinery and put much effort in living self-sustained in austerity through co-operative farming, sandal-making, and cloth-sewing. Ideally, this could be accomplished in the countryside, because, as Gandhi foresaw: ‘Machinery is like a snake-hole which may contain from one to a hundred snakes. Where there is machinery there are large cities; and where there are large cities, there are tram-cars and railways; and there only does one see electric light. … I cannot recall a single good point in connection with machinery’. Footnote 53 Nevertheless, it was the steamship that had just brought him and his ideas from Europa to the very south of Africa, where his writings were first distributed in machine print in the self-produced newspaper Indian Opinion , and later produced as a book in the Gandhi-founded, South Africa-based International Printing Press in Phoenix, Natal from where printing machines and steamships, again, distributed his words, images, and actions worldwide. Footnote 54 Steamship travel also interrupted Gandhi and Kallenbach’s journey severely after Kallenbach got arrested on their way to India during transit in the UK, because he was carrying a German passport and was considered an enemy alien during the First World War. Footnote 55 Common in all cases of radical utopian community building was indeed a certain rejection of capitalist and industrial forms of production, consumption and living; yet they were closely entwined with modernity’s entailing mobility in the globalized world. They carved out their own spaces that were regardless of spatial and semiotic distances nevertheless inevitably linked to a broader social context. They oscillated between materialized and fantasized places, being simultaneously at the margin and the centre of modern society. Footnote 56 Radical utopians seem to have internalized this oscillation of rejecting modern life and simultaneously acting towards it in promoting and living alternative but no less modern lifestyles. Their constant engagement, exchange, and movement—their doing utopia—brought about border-crossing experiences and practices that fostered creative adaptivity and self- and world-improving strategies. And as I will discuss in the following section, the main target of radical utopians’ innovations and interventions was the human body—and with it all social formations. Radical utopians’ bodies: Practices of self- and world-improvement The body is kernel to human experience, interaction, and existence—and it was pivotal to doing utopia and the building of radical utopian communities. As Karl Marx wrote in the introduction to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right : ‘To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter. But, for man, the root is man himself’. Footnote 57 Marx’s emphasis on the materiality of human experience as well as humans’ capacity to make history, I argue, is an integral part of the otherwise often overemphasized discursive imaginary, the vision of utopia. Aware or more likely unaware, radical utopians followed Marx’s lead and evidently focused the human body and its habits, allegedly in need of fundamental, profound change, and they considered a reformed body the basis to reform themselves and society—and eventually humanity at large. Footnote 58 Administrators, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries of competing and conflicting political positions and scientific approaches worldwide, among them radical utopians of different couleur, considered the human body as the smallest unit in the larger social organization that would hence require meticulous attention, labour, and care for the functioning and well-being of social organisation. In different ways, Nōson Seinen Sha’s Suzuki Yasuyuki and British anarchist George Barrett, socialist and social hygienist Auguste Forel in Switzerland, sociologist Émile Durkheim in France, evolutionist Herbert Spencer in England, imperial Japan’s ideologues’ idea of kokutai (national body), and the Nazi’s vision of the Volksgemeinschaft , fostered an understanding of society as a complex social organism that forms a whole through the functionality of all social parts and being. Footnote 59 Anarchists’ notions of social organism of course departed from nationalist, imperialist, and fascist readings of the body in crucial ways. One fundamental difference was anarchists’ opposition to state and market institutions’ dictates to form any sort of unity by emphasizing people’s voluntary association in social organization for fostering everybody’s welfare. Footnote 60 For them, the material body needed food and other necessities, to which humans should have free access. Although there was much debate among different radical utopians about food’s and other necessities’ actual form and content—the proper ingredients, so to speak—they nevertheless practiced their radical utopianism similarly in autarchic village communes such as those in Nagano, St. Catherine, and in the Transvaal, concentrating on agricultural labour, production, and consumption as the basis for communal cooperation and being. Their shared concepts and practices of labour and living moreover emphasized the body and human agency not as limited to its functionality for the whole social body, but as pivotal to individual freedom in labour and association. The body also tied labour and liberty to issues of health and morale. Radical utopian critique addressed the exploitative desire of cost-effectiveness and profit maximization in making the human body more efficient and productive on cash crop plantations as well as at factory assembly lines. Peasants and workers often answered this with their bodies’ reluctance and stubbornness to function, including boycott, sabotage, strike, and insurrections. Footnote 61 Yet, bodies’ unsmooth functioning also resulted from the body’s potential to injury, sickness, and disability. State and non-state endeavours, particularly in public health, aimed for the maintenance of productivity as much as for fighting communicable disease, which nevertheless allowed increasing intervention into the most intimate spheres of human life. Footnote 62 This popularization of the body surpassed imperial and class boundaries, and to a certain extent also those of race and gender, and it was equally exercised and promoted in more established elitist circles as in alternative, counter-cultural milieus. For adepts of the life reform movement ( Lebensreform ) and nudist hiking organizations in imperial Germany, middle-class gymnastic clubs in the British Empire, and anarchist revolutionary educators, a healthy, fit, and morally superior body became the marker of civilization and progress. Footnote 63 Radical utopian communities and their members were no exception to these developments. On the contrary, they were exceedingly active and up-to-date in practicing, promoting, and producing ideals of the reformed body to withstand, as they believed, the forces of imperialism, global capitalism, and state authority. Living in austerity, maintaining a particular diet, consuming or abstaining from certain substances, celebrating certain forms of labour, embracing physical exercises and health practices, among other things, all underscore physical practices and bodily regimes as key elements of radical utopian communities. They were at the heart of radical utopians’ identifying—or rather: subjectifying—discourse and practices, and their favour of a modern and reshaped body, whose discipline in exercise, labour, food, and living allegedly promised equality, liberty, and progress for the individual and the world. A compelling example for the gravity of the body in radical utopian communities are what Gandhi and Kallenbach have called their ‘experiments’ at Tolstoy Farm in South Africa. These experiments with body and health encompassed vegetarian diet as well as the abstention from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, which was mandatory on the Farm. They included sports and physical culture into their daily agenda, and they considered fasting a key practice for both healing and as a strategy of resistance. Footnote 64 Kallenbach, himself a gymnast and bodybuilder who had been trained by the world-touring strongman and physical culturist Eugene Sandow (with the birthname Friedrich Wilhelm Müller), enthusiastically exercised at the Farm and introduced practices of bodily fitness from the life reform movement to his fellow farmers in South Africa. Footnote 65 Walking in particular became a popular form of exercise at Tolstoy Farm, which Gandhi even considered to be the most natural and justifiable means of transportation in contrast to engine-driven mobility with automobiles and trains. Gandhi, Kallenbach and other members of the Farm took great pains in covering the distance of over thirty-five kilometres on foot between the Farm’s premises and Johannesburg to run errands. Walking long distances saved travel expenses, but even more importantly, it advertised Tolstoy Farm’s satyagraha practice to the local community and the outside world. Moreover, walking in the Transvaal was an essential training for protest marches that the Gandhi-led non-violent resistance and non-cooperation movement applied in South Africa and India, most prominently during the Salt March in 1930. Walking—physically and symbolically, quite similar to the Rastafarians’ trodding—thus bore high significant and signifying meaning, a bodily practice visualizing the practitioners’ movements in space, its appropriation, and the production of new social space. Footnote 66 All these bodily experiments, including walking, aimed at testing and stretching the limits—strengths and weaknesses—of the body, that would enable to live a life of simplicity and less need. This, in turn, makes the body independent from the forces of state and market as well as enduring the hardships of imprisonment, hunger strike, and protest. Simultaneously—and a prime example being Gandhi’s protest marches as well as staging his ascetic body during hunger strikes and at the spinning wheel—it allocates the body as a powerful image for radical utopian communities’ struggle for liberation that can and did circulate the world over and inspired people far beyond their respective locality. Abstinence and asceticism at Tolstoy Farm aimed at strengthening the body physically but also spiritually, building character as it were. This included refraining from the vices of alcohol and drugs, and also sexual desire. Gandhi was convinced of vice’s domino effect, believing that, for example, drinking alcohol is directly linked to addiction, greed, and loss of self-control, because it can inevitably lead to gambling, debauchery, prostitution, and venereal disease. Footnote 67 In Key to Health , written after his experiences in South Africa, putting alcohol consumption and opium smoking on the same level of alleged unproductive uselessness, Gandhi sums up his anti-vice conviction arguing that, ‘Under the effect of alcohol a person becomes a rowdy, whereas opium makes the addict dull and lazy. He becomes even drowsy and incapable of doing anything useful’. Footnote 68 Yet Gandhi had already developed a similar reasoning on vicious temptations and the body’s vulnerability during his sojourn at Tolstoy Farm. In his 1910 published Hind Swaraj , or Indian Home Rule , a booklet in which Gandhi demanded self-rule and non-cooperation with the colonial regime, and a text that was also an important manual for communal living in the South African project, Gandhi writes: ‘Money renders a man helpless. The other thing which is equally harmful is sexual vice. Both are poison. A snake-bite is a lesser poison than these two, because the former merely destroys the body but the latter destroy body, mind, and soul’. Footnote 69 Gandhi’s experiments with sexuality included to compel even married couples at the Farm to refrain from sex, and to educate the children on the Farm in what he calls the ‘duty of self-restraint’: he sent girls and boys to group-bathing, always under his careful supervision allegedly to ensure no trespassing. He even took these experiments to an extreme, when, decades later, he lay at night with naked young girls to prove his strength to renounce any sort of sexual desire. Footnote 70 Gandhi’s rejection of alcohol, drugs, and illicit sex was part of his broader campaign against the imperial world order. As is well understood, Gandhi’s ideal of the liberation of India, tested and adjusted in the communal experiment in South Africa, was embedded into a global movement against imperialism and colonialism. Yet, lesser known are the similarities and overlaps regarding anti-vice activism, which Gandhi shared with social and moral reformers globally campaigning against alcohol, drugs, and prostitution. Footnote 71 They all toured on similar tracks and also shared intellectual journeys, developing similar forms of physical and spiritual exercise— doing utopia —to overcome vicious temptations. Combined physical and spiritual strength as traits of the human body to challenge the alleged evil forces of civilization, radical utopians across the world argued, would foster independence from imperialism and global capitalism. This world order, they contended, grounds in labour exploitation, racist hierarchies, and the alluring powers manifest in alcohol, gambling, and illicit sex—an unholy trinity the Rastafarians have called Babylon and thus corresponds to Gandhi’s understanding of vices’ domino effect. Moreover, the Rastafarians shared a global vision to challenge these alluring powers, since Rastafari was not only countering the Babylonian conditions in Jamaica, but by extension those of the whole, especially Western world. Footnote 72 Similar to Gandhi and Kallenbach, Rastafarians proclaimed that, ‘The forces of evil’, in Ennis Edmond’s words, ‘are not metaphysical entities, but human attitudes and activities that are out of touch with the divine, natural order’. Footnote 73 Various bodily practices, including the ritual use of cannabis, ritual chants and drums, vegetarian diet, and non-exploitative, collective agricultural labour, allowed Rastafarians to distance themselves from Babylon’s forces of evil. Footnote 74 At Pinnacle, land was at the Rastafarians’ disposal, free of the post-slavery plantation system, independent of landowners demanding royalty and without foremen giving commands. As news of the opening of Pinnacle for the Rastafarian community in 1940 spread, the first euphoria prompted people almost overnight to build huts and cultivate the land by planting corn, yam, and fruits. Others started to burn coal and sold it in the nearby villages; and still others started a tannery, and a shoemaker provided the Rastafarians with their ‘power shoes’—sandals made of rawhide and rubber from old tyres. Footnote 75 Agricultural production at Pinnacle aimed first and foremost at the community’s self-sufficiency. The commune’s members worked collectively, and everyone did his or her task according to their trait, trade, and training. The Rastafarians took pride in self-sufficiency, because working for themselves and the community meant independence and no backing down to any exploitative planter, crooked investor or any other (state) authority as their work would be the foundation of their own survival. This also took journalist John Carradine by surprise, who visited the Rastafarian community on a Sunday and expected to witness mystic rituals. Conversely, ‘It was in every wit like an ordinary working day’, he wrote in 1940, ‘men in the fields with cutlasses weeding, women looking after their household duties, shoemakers plying the awls, carpenters their tools’. Footnote 76 Indeed, contrary to established stereotypes at the time, the Rastafarians were not a religious sect but much more occupied with selling their surplus handicrafts, coal, and fruits and vegetables on the local market; apparently they also owned a bakery in Kingston. Their most popular agricultural product, however, was marijuana, or ganja in the Jamaican vernacular, which allowed the commune to gain massive income as the island’s largest producer of cannabis. Yet, this economic success brought also about the commune’s downfall as imperial anti-drug legislation was the pretext that enabled the colonial police to repeatedly raid and eventually destroy the Pinnacle Commune in 1958. Footnote 77 Similar to Gandhi and Kallenbach, the Rastafarians embraced the idea of natural living, which they similarly practiced in labour and eating. Food was to be self-produced and unprocessed, meaning without the “Babylonian” food processing machinery, which included products from cash-crop plantations and other trade-for-profit fruits and vegetables as from the hands of companies like United Fruits, as well as food refining and canning factories. Local, organic, and self-made were thus the key ingredients of Rastafarian food practices, which later became known as ‘Ital’. Footnote 78 Some Rastafarians have been practicing strict vegetarianism, others were and are following the Biblical food restrictions of the old Israelites. The Rastafarian term ‘Ital’ foods is already expressing this in its everyday practice, as ‘Ital’ is another Rastafarian neologism that has cut the ‘v’ from ‘vital’ and replaced it with the ‘I’ to emphasize and verbalize the ‘Jah’, short for Jehovah, which signifies the divine presence in all things and practices that matter to the Rastafarians, a divinity that equals being natural, pure, and here clean for bodily ingestion, and which is an integral part of the Rastafarian’s responsibility and everyday practice. Footnote 79 Japanese anarchists of the Nōson Seinen Sha equally emphasized the importance of food in their radical utopian community and the overall anarchist revolution, also in terms of purity and truth. Yet, this was not due to food’s divinity or one’s ascetic discipline, but because food and its equal distribution would ultimately determine emancipatory social organization. Illuminating is the Nōson Seinen Sha’s choice for the pseudonym Pan to Jiyūsha (Bread and Liberty Society), which the group used for several publications. The naming itself already bears a temporality that signifies priorities: first bread, then liberty. The premise for—and promise of—true liberation through social revolution, they argued, was rooted in the satisfaction of material human needs, which would take its most simple beginning in appeasing one’s hunger. Only afterwards the modes of production and complex social organization would take place. Footnote 80 This is most apparent in the anarchist analysis of food and its distribution by George Barrett in his Anarchist Revolution (1920), which Nōson Seinen Sha member Suzuki Yasuyuki translated into Japanese in 1930: Like an organism [sic!], [the] free society grows into being, from the simple unit up to the complex structure. The need for bread, hunger—or, in other words, the individual struggle to live, in its most simple and elementary form—is […] sufficient to set the whole complex social machinery in motion. Society is the result of the individual struggle for existence; it is not, as many suppose, opposed to it. Footnote 81 Along Barrett-cum-Suzuki’s line of argument, food (here: bread) turns into an ordering principle. This social organization, grounding in autarkic agricultural villages and small-scale industrial workshops, could do without and eventually dispend (state) authority, privilege, and unequal distribution of power. In order to initiate a decentralised and liberated society, the Nōson Seinen Sha argued, it would be necessary to put human needs and their satisfaction first and subordinate production and socio-economic control. The biggest hurdle to achieve a truly liberated society is any system of accumulating capital and state power, in which production and state rule determine people’s needs. In this regard, they operated with a terminology of purity and truth, based in scientific reasoning, as they claimed their anarcho-communist model of overcoming capital, empire, and state with a consumption-focused social re-organization as ‘pure anarchism’ ( junsei museifushugi ). Footnote 82 Their conception of purity and truth was inspired by Kropotkin’s idea of ‘mutual aid’— sōgo fujo in Japanese, which had universalist aspirations, because for the Nōson Seinen Sha the most important task was bringing about radical social change by implementing co-operatist communalism as part of a globally synchronic endeavour for the liberation of human life all over the world. Footnote 83 We do not know much about the actual daily life of the Nōson Seinen Sha’s radical utopian community project in imperial Japan’s hinterland of Nagano prefecture. Yet, the group’s members provided highly sophisticated elaborations of agriculture, work, and community. Miyazaki Akira even celebrated the farming village as the key site for social revolution. The three main tasks, he argued, are to live in autarchy, to possess only shared property, and to build communal welfare based on mutual aid. Less attentive to a vegetarian diet as well as alcohol and drugs, Japanese anarchists nevertheless saw similar dangers to the body, which they similarly emphasised in terms of labour, community, and nature. For their part, they saw the body endangered by corruption not so much by the evils of alcohol, drugs, and illicit sex, but by exploitation, profit, and money. Similar to Gandhi’s assessment of man’s helplessness and the Rastafarians’ disgust of Babylonian evil when it comes to the harmfulness of money, Nōson Seinen Sha member Miyazaki Akira declared that, ‘With the birth of money in society happiness vanishes’. Money, he argued, enables exploitation through profit and division of labour, and considered it therefore a force eroding solidarity, because it would divide people and nature, humans and their products, farmers and workers, cities and countryside. Self-sufficient farming within the village community and shared property, Miyazaki concluded, would contain the threat of money, and prevent the establishment of hierarchies. Footnote 84 Moreover, money—linking and enabling property and exploitation—also threatened individual freedom, social organization, and nature in another way. According to Japanese anarchists, rejecting money and, with it, capitalist modes of production, particularly in the industrial sector, also overcomes capitalism’s expansion and imperialism’s aggression. It would be a mistake to think that people’s participation in an imperial collaborating society ( kyōdō shakai ), contributing through labour and tax payment to a society that is nevertheless controlled by the imperial state, its institutions, and interests, would establish national unity and imperial strength to everyone’s benefit. On the contrary, Miyazaki argued, the government’s call for unity and security would be a distraction, and only the ruling class ( shihai gaikyū ) would benefit from people’s hard labour and tax payment. Ultimately, he even considered money, taxes, and capitalism to be the foundation for war and Japan’s imperial expansion in Asia since particularly modern industrial production is indispensable for modern war—and arguably vice versa. Footnote 85 The evils of money and profit-making are thus not only undermining and threatening the well-being of the individual and the social body through exploitation of labour power. Rather, money, profit and exploitation generate war—a condition that inevitably hurts the individual and social body. War, as has been underscored by Elaine Scarry, has its main purpose and outcome in injuring. Moreover, in war ‘the incontestable reality of the body—the body in pain, the body maimed, the body dead and hard to dispose—is separated from its source and conferred on an ideology or issue or instance of political authority impatient of, or deserted by, benign sources of substantiation’. Footnote 86 Japanese anarchists’ rejection of the vicious forces of money, profit, and exploitation—similarly grasped in Gandhi’s satyagraha as well as in the Rastafarian’s fight against Babylon—addressed war as the ultimate destructive force targeting the human body and human existence. Radical utopians’ only weapons against these forces of capitalism, imperialism, and modernity, they believed, were their untainted bodies, also as symbols of their pure existence and universal truth of their communal being. Conclusion: Complicating connectivity and the body Radical utopian communities and their efforts of doing utopia the world over were an integral part of the modern world and early twentieth-century global structural transformations across different cultural, national, and imperial locales. Despite all their differences, intriguingly similar, they built self-sufficient communes, pursued agricultural labour, journeyed the world physically and intellectually, and reformed the body as kernel to the human condition and all social relations. Navigating within and beyond the confines of imperial formations, they all articulated—and practiced—decided critiques against imperialism, capitalism, and state authority. To emphasize all these similarities, however, is not to uncover an ideal type of radical utopian communities. Rather, similarity underscores that even separated radical utopian communities developed similar visions, operated with analogous poetics, and addressed the same debates, and that they shared a global consciousness as they were convinced that their doing utopia would ultimately be making history. Footnote 87 However, bringing similar yet different radical utopian communities into conversation—in particular with a focus on mobility and the body—also requires complicating similarity and global connectivity. To begin with, modern mobility being a key aspect of radical utopian community building bares a certain irony: all radical utopian communities shared a critique against capitalism, imperialism, and state power, yet they were themselves constitutive to or at least part of it—at times one might even say complicit. Gandhi’s relationship with steam-powered machinery—simultaneously repulsive and supportive—is emblematic for this contradictory concurrence, as is his legal anti-colonial campaigns that were nevertheless embedded into the rule of law as the foundation of the British Empire. Footnote 88 Indeed, arguably the most pronounced, somewhat ironic, yet nevertheless historically specific characteristic of radical utopian communities was their experience of capitalist modernity that manifested in their very critique of capitalist modernity itself. Footnote 89 Furthermore, the existence of intriguing overlaps of methods and practices of self- and world-improvement across ideological divides still does not simply imply a more unified and standardized world. It even raises attention to the increasing diversification of the globalized world. Shalini Randeria has recognized this ambivalence, arguing that entangled or connected history is indeed narrating a ‘geteilte Geschichte’, which bares the double meaning of shared and divided . Footnote 90 Hence, it would be misleading to romanticize any revolutionary and emancipatory solidarity by ignoring the intimate encounter, the ‘tense and tender ties’ within radical utopian communities. Footnote 91 They were not free of hierarchies, and its participants also appropriated, negotiated, and failed to overcome boundaries of race, class, gender, and sexuality—despite a prevailing rhetoric of liberation. Gandhi was exceedingly racist and misogynist, complaining about the allegedly ‘lazy Black laborers’ and ordered women ‘to be chaste’ while he himself engaged in homo-erotic experiments with Herman Kallenbach. Among Japanese anarchists, race and gender as analytical categories for criticising asymmetries of power were most conspicuous through their absence as all the abstract rhetoric of a cosmological liberation and social organization in mutual aid never addressed issues such as racism and sexism. And Rastafarianism, despite being very attentive to the history of class, race and racial hierarchies, is over-patriarchal. Finally, one vivid yet also highly problematic attraction shared among all three communities was ‘nature’ and ‘natural living’ as reoccurring tropes in their doing utopia . These tropes expressed the desire and search for a supposedly authentic, just, and even life that would not have been deteriorated by the forces of global capitalism. Such desire, produced by the very same means of capitalist production that constantly produce global unevenness, as Siegfried Kracauer has illustrated contemporaneously, would open the gates to conservative and reactionary ideas and explanations of organic communal belonging, and potentially to fascism. Footnote 92 With their uncritical longing for nature, radical utopians, to various degrees, were also in danger of entering this slippery slope, which manifested in Rastafarian Ital food, Satyagrahian simplicity or anarchist rice-paddy-harmony that were part and parcel of radical utopian communities’ self-sufficient agricultural life as antithesis to capitalism, colonial rule, and the imperial state. Fortunately, they never got to the bottom of that slope. In sum, a close look at the everyday experiences and practices within radical utopian communities beyond the discursive demystifies the image of borderless cosmopolitan mobility, and also offers an important critique of the ideals of communal harmony. Footnote 93 Radical utopian ideals and interventions could liberate and undermine established social existence, but sometimes also affirm the allegedly clear-cut boundaries and hierarchies of modern society. Yet perspectives on and from the margins offer an ideal opportunity to analyse the range—and limits—of actors of globalization, the circulation of knowledge, and strategies of intervention. Investigating and connecting the different yet similar radical utopian communities and their doing utopia is one way, among many others, of exploring opportunities to narrate a decentred global history of the early twentieth century. And it ultimately demonstrates that alternative life worlds were not mere naïve dreams or failures, and not as marginalized after all, but actually accomplished: done utopias.\'}, {\'title\': \'Examples of Utopia: Types and Features of Ideal Societies\', \'url\': \'https://www.yourdictionary.com/articles/examples-utopia-types-features\', \'content\': \'Have you ever pictured the perfect world through the words of your favorite novel? Then you\\\'ve thought about a utopia. This word actually came from literature when Sir Thomas More used the word utopia to describe the perfect island. Get a clear idea of what a utopia is and see several utopia examples. When you think of the perfect world, you might think of heaven or a world with no wars. Several writers and philosophers have tried to imagine the perfect world. But by definition, the term utopia refers to an ideal or place in which all aspects are perfect or nearly so. So, where did utopia come from? Sir Thomas More created the concept name in 1516 as the title of his book, Utopia . Within his book, More created a fictional description of an island that had the qualities of perfection. Since then, many writers and philosophers have tried to create a utopian society. However, most fictional utopias actually turn out to be a dystopia, an imaginary world with suffering and injustice. A prime example of a utopia that\\\'s actually a dystopia is seen in George Orwell\\\'s 19 84 . You can also view a dystopia in Aldous Huxley\\\'s Brave New World . Examples of utopia, in various contexts, as represented through literature, art, popular culture, and other means include: The Garden of Eden, an aesthetically pleasing place in which there was "no knowledge of good and evil" Heaven, a religious supernatural place where God, angels and human souls live in harmony Shangri-La, in James Hilton\\\'s Lost Horizon, a mystical harmonious valley Tao Yuanming\\\'s The Peach Blossom Spring, which describes a beautiful secluded community not affected by the rest of the world Ellis\\\'s description in Specimens of Early English Poets of the Land of Cockaigne , a place where "houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry" The entire Golden A ge as described by Hesiod, a Greek poet The Federation in the Star Trek series The Capital in The Hunger Games series, a place of luxury and freedoms England in Aldous Huxley\\\'s Brave New World , a place with no wars or hunger but also no emotion The term utopia was originally a description of a social environment and has manifested in many ways. The idea of "world peace" is considered utopian in nature, and United States communes were attempts at utopian ways of living. However, there are several different features of an ideal society. In an ecological utopia, the society would work in harmony with the nature around them. Rather than producing waste and pollution, people would become one with nature to have ecological harmony. Utopian idealism took off after the 18th century. Those seeking economic utopia are partially responsible for the development of commercialism and capitalism, although they were combined with some socialist characteristics in the early 19th century. Much of the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was working toward a self-sustaining utopian economy. Religious utopias exist in concept, both as intra-religious ideals as well as inter-religious. In these types of societies, faith controls every aspect of a person\\\'s life, creating religious harmony. For example, the Amish community works towards religious utopia. Scientific utopias pertain to the idea of perfection in terms of living standards. Means of attempting to achieve utopia through science include ideas that omit death and suffering from life or make the human condition perfect. Scientific and technological utopias are oftentimes connected. Technological utopian lifestyles would be those that replace human needs or functions with technology in such a way that humans have a higher quality of life. An example of a technology utopia is Francis Bacon\\\'s New Atlantis . You have seen many different examples of utopia, so it\\\'s easy to imagine your own utopia by thinking of your idea of the perfect society or the perfect world. Now that you’ve had a taste of utopia, check out examples of dystopia .\'}, {\'title\': \'Top 30 Examples of Utopia: Definition & Types - BitGlint\', \'url\': \'https://www.bitglint.com/examples-of-utopia-definition-types/\', \'content\': \'1.

In theory, it provides a perfect system of government, an abundance of opportunities, and fair distribution of resources. Below are some potential privileges and benefits that people might experience in a Utopian society: Free Healthcare: In a Utopian society, healthcare would be free, ensuring that everyone has access to adequate care without financial hardship. Free Education: Education would be accessible and free, empowering people with knowledge, skills, and critical thinking to make informed decisions. Guaranteed Basic Income: Everyone would be guaranteed a basic income, ensuring that everyone has the resources they need to survive and thrive. Freedom of Expression: Utopian societies would allow freedom of expression, where people are free to worship, vote, criticize and hold different beliefs without fear of persecution. Clean Environment: The environment would be clean and protected, allowing people to enjoy nature and live in harmony with it. Equal Opportunities: Everyone would have equal access to opportunities, including employment, housing, education, and healthcare. Peaceful Coexistence: Utopian society would be free from crime, war, and violence, ensuring that people can live in peace and harmony with each other. Shared Responsibility: In a utopian society, everyone would take collective responsibility for the sustainability and maintenance of their community, leading to a sense of shared purpose and fulfillment. It is essential to note that achieving a utopian society is an ideal that may be difficult to achieve in practice, but striving towards it can help create a society with more equity, justice, and sustainability.\'}, {\'title\': \'Building a Utopia: Achieving a Society Through Social Democratic ...\', \'url\': \'https://socialistcurrents.org/?p=4833\', \'content\': \'By Allen Coleman In a world plagued by war, inequality, and injustice, the idea of a utopian society where these issues are obsolete may seem far-fetched. However, the principles of social democracy offer a realistic and achievable path to such a society. Imagine a world where war is unheard of, where human dignity is upheld, and where the needs of the people are met through the collective value placed on labor. In this world, the government exists solely to serve the working class, and the workers themselves play a pivotal role in shaping the future. This is the vision of a social democratic utopia—an ideal rooted in equity, cooperation, and respect for human dignity. The Foundational Principles of Social Democracy At the heart of social democracy lies a commitment to economic justice, democratic participation, and equality under the law. These principles provide the foundation for a system that ensures everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background or social status. Economic Justice Economic justice is the cornerstone of a social democratic society. The goal is to create a system where the wealth generated by society is distributed fairly. This can be achieved through progressive taxation, where those who have more contribute more to the common good. In addition, social safety nets such as universal healthcare, free education, and affordable housing ensure that basic needs are met for everyone, regardless of their financial situation. In such a system, no one is left behind, and every person can contribute meaningfully to society without fear of poverty or deprivation. Democratic Participation A defining feature of social democracy is the active participation of citizens in the political process. In a social democratic utopia, governance is not limited to elected officials but is instead a collective endeavor. Workers are empowered to participate in decision-making at all levels, from local councils to national policy. This is achieved through strong labor unions, workplace democracy, and public participation in government through mechanisms like participatory budgeting and citizen assemblies. These processes ensure that the voices of the working class are not only heard but are central to the decision-making that shapes society. Rule of Law and Equality A just society is one where the rule of law applies equally to all people. In a social democratic utopia, equality before the law is paramount. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or social class has no place in such a society. The government upholds civil rights and ensures that the legal system is fair, transparent, and accessible to everyone. This creates a foundation of trust and respect between the government and its citizens, fostering a sense of shared purpose and commitment to the common good. Steps to Transition into a Social Democratic Society Transitioning to a social democratic society requires significant reforms in both the economic and political spheres, as well as a cultural shift in how people view labor, government, and community. Economic Transformation One of the first steps in realizing a social democratic utopia is to transform the economy. This includes promoting cooperative enterprises, worker-owned businesses, and shared ownership models where the benefits of labor are equitably distributed. In such a system, wealth is not concentrated in the hands of a few, but is instead shared among the people who contribute to its creation. Wealth redistribution mechanisms, such as progressive taxation and social safety nets, ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to live a dignified life. Political Reform Political reform is equally essential to creating a social democratic utopia. A political system based on proportional representation ensures that all voices are heard and that no single group can dominate the political landscape. Campaign finance reforms are necessary to limit the influence of corporations and wealthy elites, ensuring that government policy is shaped by the will of the people rather than corporate interests. By limiting the power of money in politics, social democracy empowers ordinary citizens to shape the future of their society. Cultural Shift A cultural shift is also necessary to make the vision of a social democratic utopia a reality. People must come to recognize the intrinsic value of labor, not just as a means of personal gain, but as a way to contribute to the common good. Education plays a critical role in fostering this mindset. A robust education system that promotes critical thinking, civic engagement, and empathy can help instill values of cooperation, solidarity, and respect for all members of society. The Role of Government in Serving the Working Class In a social democratic utopia, the government’s role is to serve the needs of the working class. This means that policies must prioritize the rights and well-being of workers, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize and collectively bargain. The government also invests heavily in public infrastructure, ensuring that healthcare, education, and transportation are accessible to all, regardless of income. Moreover, the government must be adaptive and responsive to the needs of the people. By using participatory budgeting and citizen assemblies, the government can ensure that policies reflect the priorities and concerns of the population. In such a society, the government is not an external force imposing its will on the people, but a servant of the people, working to create a society that reflects their collective values. Challenges and How to Address Them While the vision of a social democratic utopia is compelling, there are significant challenges toovercome. One of the most significant challenges is resistance from powerful elites who benefit from the current system of inequality. To address this, social democratic movements must build strong coalitions among grassroots organizations, workers, and progressive groups to counteract the influence of the wealthy few. Another challenge is the pressure of globalization, which often favors multinational corporations over national governments. However, social democratic countries can work together to promote international solidarity, creating a global network of cooperation that transcends borders. Finally, maintaining the integrity of the system is crucial. Social democracies must establish strong checks and balances to prevent the concentration of power and avoid authoritarian tendencies. By continually adapting to the needs of the people and ensuring that power remains in the hands of the many rather than the few, social democracies can safeguard their values of equality, justice, and democracy. The Benefits of a Social Democratic Utopia The benefits of a social democratic utopia are profound. First and foremost, such a society would eliminate the need for war. By fostering global cooperation and prioritizing diplomacy over militarization, conflict becomes a relic of the past. Furthermore, a social democratic society would foster thriving communities where people’s basic needs are met, and poverty is eradicated. The resulting sense of security and shared purpose would allow individuals to lead fulfilling lives, contributing meaningfully to society while enjoying a high quality of life. Ultimately, a social democratic utopia is a society where personal fulfillment and collective well-being are not in competition but are seen as mutually reinforcing. In this world, every person is valued, every voice matters, and every person has the opportunity to contribute to the common good.

Alas, afraid of how the world is evolving; eager to keep for ourselves what we have; willing to preserve the certainties that we have built in our heads; enticed by a new philosophy where we are supposed to maximise happiness — we continue to resist and reject change. Why embrace the future if it is this painful? Why become aware that our world is collapsing? To avoid a growing sense of helplessness and despair, we then run faster towards that light at the end of the tunnel. Instead of embracing the unknown, we become even more blinded by what we think we know. Companies only learn agility in order to increase productivity, grow their revenues and make more profit. Governments engage in stakeholder consultations but their conclusions, coincidentally, always happen to confirm the initial intentions of those in power. People are concerned about plastic in our oceans but they ignore why this issue has become so salient. We change in order to remain the same and this is not good enough to meet today’s challenges. As Einstein wrote in 1946, “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.” Utopian rationality In my teaching, I invite executives and directors to become smarter than rational. I do not propose to throw out rationality. Rather, I want to overcome a rationality that imposes itself upon a complex reality in a totalitarian fashion. To identify a goal, choose the best action to reach it, then measure the consequences and finally claim success once the task is done is not smart enough. In a world full of surprises, we need to dream beyond our goals if they are to have meaning. A sense of purpose is essential for long-term value creation, as the dream that drives our goals will ensure the relevance of work beyond the next quarter or business cycle. We also need to realise that we may not attain our goals, and that can be an opportunity because they may need to be changed. We should never be prisoners of our goals. Anchored in our values, we can appreciate where we are at present and have our eyes fully open. Instead of serving a system that is at risk of destroying our humanity, we should make sure to put the framework of rationality to the service of our values and dreams. It is also a powerful strategic exercise. At INSEAD, my experience is that the building of a utopia allows executives and directors to free their minds from confining intellectual prejudices. The method draws from the three core principles of Wise Power: duality of mind, emotional maturity and generosity of soul. It is a way of thinking, feeling and dreaming that enhances our ability to meet the world half-way. It is especially useful for important and difficult decisions. Wise power consists of the ability to face surprising, even unpleasant truths bravely and honestly, although they may directly contradict our firmly held beliefs and preferences. Wise leaders are much less susceptible to the fear of the unknown that underlies defensiveness, because they perceive the deeper dynamics of the landscape around them. Instead of being fixated on the light at the end of the tunnel, they learn to pause and see that the tunnel is in fact made of beautiful trees, each of which is also a door to another space where they can discover, learn or just be. How to generate a utopia? Now more than ever, strategic business decisions must be taken in light of other realms of power. It is thus essential that utopias encompass the political, social, technological and natural spheres, as well as business. This allows leaders to embrace the growing expectations of multiple stakeholders across myriad issues. Complex, ambiguous grey zones have a perfect right to exist in these utopias. For example, you do not have to choose between business having freedom to operate, and governments possessing scope to regulate – you can have both. As participants present their utopias in class, it is liberating for them to express these contradictions. Executives are typically constrained in a discourse where business interests dictate everything. However, they are also citizens eager to exist more fully and freely at work. As they share their utopias and listen to others’, they become conscious of common predominant themes: a form of social equality, a government that cares for the common good, technology at the service of humans and not the other way around, and harmony with nature, among others. These commonalities transform what might have seemed an exercise in fanciful idealism into something highly relevant to the everyday exercise of executive power. The unthinkable suddenly becomes almost feasible. The lines between utopianism and executives’ habitual “realism” begin to blur. Why utopia? Peel back the layers of realism, and you will often find cynicism and pessimism feeding fear a steady diet of rationalisation, e.g. the world is so corrupt, boldly engaging with it is useless. Some cynicism and pessimism can also be valuable. Life is not black and white -- and we also need to tame some messianic tendencies that bring us back to the authoritarian form of leadership that we want to transform. , in terms of what could be. It gives us the courage and confidence to see the distance between reality and our dreams as a space of opportunity rather than ipso facto defeat. Applications of utopia Utopian thinking can be open-ended, but it can also be tailored to address specific business problems. I have used it to find solutions for a multinational energy company facing a disastrous situation. The company was heavily criticised in the media for its role in the environmental devastation and worsening quality of life of local communities. In response to being painted as villains in the press, executives had adopted a stance of denial of their responsibility. Their relationships with community leaders and government officials were at an impasse. By inviting participants to conceive of the best resolution imaginable for such conflicts, we foster within them an appetite for the unknown. They start envisioning ways to use their companies’ wealth and power for mutual value creation, together with locals on the ground. Most importantly, they become more aware of the pitfalls of a confrontational non-market strategy. Instead of maintaining the belief that they can save the world if they become a force for good (another way to remain in the ego-driven authoritarian form of leadership), companies can cultivate a global vision in which they interact with other forms of power in a more respectful and harmonious manner. Imagining utopias can also be useful for established organisations in the midst of market flux. For instance, a session on utopian thinking applied to the future of mobility allowed executives of a car manufacturer to better appreciate the multiple facets and layers of their situation. Rather than being constrained by the established discourse and culture of their company, they could engage at different levels and discuss the deeper changes driving the shifts in their industry. They were developing a sense of where they stood within this larger ecosystem and could find new levers to shape their culture and their identity. Instead of nurturing fear and helplessness, their uncertain future provided meaning. Developing utopia You do not need to wait for other people to apply utopian thinking. You can start yourself as an individual. Just think of a high-level challenge facing your organisation, industry, or even the nation or region in which you do business. Then apply your imagination to the problem, working through the different perspectives of the relevant stakeholders. Do not fear contradictions and allow space for the commonalities of good intentions and diversity of values. As a transformation of your own mind-set, the exercise will teach you to fear less and embrace more. You can scale up the benefit by involving your team – sharing your ideas with them and adding their contributions until a collective utopia emerges. This dream will help you select your objectives and identify the key stakeholders that can help you. It will also change your attitude to the world. Less afraid to envision change, you will look for opportunities to contribute to a better world beyond strict business objectives.\'}, {\'title\': \'The Value of Utopia: The American Tradition of Radical Utopianism ...\', \'url\': \'https://www.hamptonthink.org/read/the-value-of-utopia-the-american-tradition-of-radical-utopianism\', \'content\': \'By Nick Partyka For many centuries persons, peoples, and civilizations, have dreamed about what an ideal society (utopia) would look like, and worried about ways in which society could be much worse (dystopia). Utopian dreams and dystopian worries are powerful tools for thinking about what sorts of changes a society should pursue or avoid, and what underlying dynamics these proposed changes expose. This series examines the tradition of utopian and dystopian thought in western culture, beginning with the ancient Greeks, but continuing on into the modern period. Our focus in this series will be on the important social, political, and economic ideas and issues raised in different utopian stories. When we look into utopian stories, and their historical times, what we\\\'ll see reflected in the stories of utopia are the social, political, and economic concerns of the authors, their societies, and or their particular social class. The meaning of the word \\\'utopia\\\' comes to us from ancient Greece. In our modern world the word takes its current form because of Thomas More\\\'s 1516 book of the same name. Indeed, it is this book from which most of the modern western European utopian tradition takes its origin; or at least, this work inaugurates its most common trope. Where we have in our lexicon one \\\'utopia\\\', the Greeks had two. The difference, even confusion, between them marks an essential cleavage. For the Greeks, there was both Eu- topia, and Ou-topia. Both are derived in part from the Greek word topos , which means "place", and the suffix \\\' ia \\\' meaning land. Translated into English, \\\'Ou-topia\\\' means something like, " No-place land", whereas \\\'Eu-topia\\\' translates as "good-place land". More succinctly, the difference is between the idea of the best place, and an impossible place. It is the difference between a place which does not exist, because it has not yet been realized, and a place which cannot, and could not, ever exist. Our modern word is pronounced as the Greeks pronounced \\\'Eutopia\\\'. However, the meanings of these Greek words were confused by modern writers, who ended up with the spelling \\\'utopia\\\', from the old English \\\'Utopie\\\' as opposed to "Eutopia", as meaning "good place". This basic confusion about utopias, between "good place" and "no place", inserts an important ambiguity directly in the center of thinking about utopias. This ambiguity forces one to wonder of utopian writers, Are their visions supposed to be dreams of possible futures meant to incite us to action, or are they impossible dreams meant as reminders that the world is not easily re-shaped by human effort? Is a utopia supposed to be a good place or a no-place? Is the author supporting or condemning the practices of the fictional societies they describe? One qualification must be made right away. A utopia is not a paradise. There is a colloquial usage of \\\'utopia\\\' and \\\'utopian\\\' that seem to suggest that it is a paradise. And compared to the societies in which actual humans lives, many of the fictional utopias would have indeed been seen as paradises, relatively speaking. However, we must draw a technical distinction between a paradise or a golden-age, and a utopia. In a paradise or golden-age no work and no effort are required by humans to obtain the things they want and need. Perhaps the most famous golden-age many are familiar with would be the Biblical Garden of Eden. Another well-known paradise is described in the mid-14th century poem The Land of Cockaigne , where fully cooked turkey legs literally fly through the air and into one\\\'s mouth. In this place the only effort one need put in is to chew. The whole idea of a Cockaigne, or a paradise, is that everything one would ever need is abundantly supplied without any effort. The natural world is just so constructed - either at random or by design - that there springs forth automatically an abundance of everything necessary for everyone, all the time, always. In this kind of society, or world, there never arises anything resembling what we - or most societies in the history of our world - call a political problem. Everyone has enough of everything. So there is no cause for argument. There is no inequality, because everyone has everything everyone else has. Or at least, everyone has access to just as much of what others have whenever they would like it. In this kind of world what causes could there be for strife, or for civil war? A paradise, or a golden-age, is thus totally non-political, and not terribly interesting. What this means is that utopias are enough like our own condition, our own world, that we can take inspiration from them. They are enough like the social conditions we know that we can learn lessons for and about ourselves and our societies by examining at them. This is exactly what makes utopias so interesting. As we will see, utopian literature has a long, very long, history with human beings. The enduring appeal of and, interest in utopias testifies to their relevance. This is the reason that we too are looking at utopias. We are all concerned with, or at least we are all effected by, the way our society is organized. By looking at how other ideal societies might be organized we can explore the merits, and demerits of various kinds of social institutions, and of the various ways of structuring those institutions. We are concerned to change our own society, and utopias allow us to think about the direction of that change. We have a colloquial usage of the word \\\'utopia\\\' and \\\'utopian\\\' in contemporary society that works to prohibit much creative thought, and dismisses utopian thought as feckless, and as such, worthless. Part of the aims of this series is to demonstrate the value of this "worthless" endeavor. Dreaming, far from idle, far from impotent, is essential. Without wonder, without questions, the human imagination will atrophy. The value of utopia is that thinking about utopias allows us to both critique present societies, and also to articulate a vision of how we\\\'d like our societies to be different. The deeper value of utopian thinking is that it sets us free, free to speculate and more importantly to give expression to our striving, to our desire for a better world. Everything human beings can be must first be dreamed by human beings. This is the value of utopia and dystopia. Thus, the first pre-requisite for this series is the rejection of this colloquial notion of utopia and the utopian. Dismissed from the start, it will not be a surprise if we fail to learn anything from our utopian traditions. Introduction Brief, but spectacular. That is how I think of the Occupy movement. An article I read recently lamented that the anniversaries of this movement seem to come and go now with but a murmur, a faint echo of the voice that all too briefly seemed capable of shaking American society out of complacency, of opening up new possibilities. There have by now been enough autopsies of this movement, and its failures, that there is no need for another. One thing that stands out is of course the fact that the movement never coalesced around a set of demands, never formulated a coherent political programme. Whether or not the Occupy movement did a good job distilling its critique, and its vision, neither were sufficiently theoretically developed or promulgated. Occupy in many senses seem to try to be a leaderless and theory-less movement. Of course, the main reason for the end of the Occupy movement was the physical clearance of the encampments by the thugs of the ruling class, that is, the police. Much more fruitfully, when we look to the practice of Occupy, and the many encampments around the country, and indeed around the world, we can see that there is certainly a clear political, and moral ethos animating the activity and structure of the movement. What emerged from the Occupy encampments was an ethos of self-organization, free association, of de-centralized participatory democracy, and non-market modes of distribution. In Occupy encampments around the country people organized themselves to provide many kinds of basic, and some more advanced, services and community infrastructure, e.g. free meals, free educational opportunities, free healthcare, and much more. The diversity of services offered by different Occupy encampments was truly an amazing display of cooperation, solidarity, and self-organization. And indeed, this is what was really threatening about the occupy movement, it offered a robust vision of a more participatory, more solidaristic form of community, and worked diligently to create this, first within the bounds of its camps, and then the communities around the camps. Building up a vision of a new society, and a physical representation of that vision, became a major challenge to the ruling class because of the speed with which this movement grew and gathered strength. Occupy was not the first time "utopian" ideas of more democratic, more participatory, more egalitarian, forms of community captured the imagination of Americans, and threatened the ruling class by becoming a movement. This has happened several times in our history, but, as one might expect, these lie outside the mainstream narrative of U.S. history. Thankfully, in the wake of Howard Zinn, much work has been done to recover and disseminate the knowledge and memory of the existence of radicals and revolutionaries, not to mention their important role, in American history. Utopian ideas, and vision of better societies have captured the imagination of Americans, and become large movements more than once. These largely forgotten episodes include the Bellamyite movement in the 1890s, and the Fourierist movement of the 1840s. These latter two represent the more secular and political end of the spectrum of utopian experiments in American history. Looking Backwards, on Bellamyism While it is almost totally forgotten now, at the end of the 19th century, the only American works of fiction to sell more copies than Edward Bellamy\\\'s Looking Backwards were Uncle Tom\\\'s Cabin , and Ben-Hur . His book, and the ideas and vision contained in it, was so wildly popular that is spawned an intense, but short-lived political movement in the form of Bellamyite "Nationalist Clubs"; indeed they were often called "Bellamy Clubs". These clubs arose quickly following the release of Bellamy\\\'s novel, and while the first club originated in Boston, chapters soon popped up in cities across the nation. These clubs, via coordinated activity, became a political force as a movement in the first half of the last decade of the nineteenth century, before disappearing after merging with the Populist movement. They turned Bellamy himself into a politician, although he was perhaps not well suited to the role of leader of a socialist political movement. When Looking Backward was published in 1888 its popularity owed much to its readability, engaging narrative, but especially to its grand vision of a utopian future. Another big part of its popularity was conditioned by the times in which its author lived. Over the course of Edward Bellamy\\\'s forty-eight years he saw a great deal of turmoil, indeed, he would have been around fifteen the year the Civil war ended, and not quite twenty five when the Long Depression began in 1873. After the war American society experienced the rise of giant integrated capitalist firms - the infamous trusts - to positions of monopoly power; it had experienced a series of sometimes devastating economic recessions and depressions; it was experiencing increasing labor militance and strikes, for example the Great Strike of 1887; in conjunction with the latter, there was much radical socialist political agitation, see for example the 1886 Haymarket Affair and its highly controversial aftermath. Over this time the social effects of capitalism and industrialization became more pronounced. As is the still the case, it was workers, and the poor who bore the costs of material "progress". From the end of the Civil war to the turn of the century was when American capitalism really came into its own, when it rose to social and political dominance. As material prosperity of society increased, it looked to increasingly many Americans that, economically and politically, the decked was stacked against them, and that the lion\\\'s share of these gains were being accumulated by the wealthy. Bellamy adopts the Rip Van Winkle trope and has his protagonist fall asleep in then present-day 1887, and wake up over a century later in the year 2000. Bellamy\\\'s hero, Julian West, finds himself in a utopian future society in which the evils of the world of 1887 have been rectified through application of reason, science, and technology. The book takes the form of a kind of guided tour of the future given to Julian by his host, a Dr. Leete, who is caring for Julian after he wakes up. Dr. Leete and his family take turns escorting Julian around, showing him different aspects of the future, and answering his many questions about how the world of the future works, and how things came to be that way. Long story short, the Unites States of the future has been transformed by a rational and irresistible bloodless revolution into a socialist utopia, as one giant national trust, operated for the public benefit. All industries have been nationalized, and are democratically controlled by their workers; there is centralized distribution of important goods; there is gender equality; the economy has been reorganized as a rational and egalitarian "Industrial Army". As Bellamy describes this future, there are no wars, no government, no bankers, no corruption, no jails, and no more "buying" and "selling". The social revolution that brings about the society of the future, as Bellamy presents it, occurs much like Marx describes. The revolution is a natural occurrence, and as such irresistible, that happened once society developed to a certain level of rationality. Once people become sufficiently rational they simply perceive the need to radically transform society, and then do so in the form of a revolutionary mass social movement that peacefully takes power and then restructures society. Bellamy, like many of his age, was not keen to abandon the benefits of industrialization, and mass production, but wanted to change the composition and distribution of what is produced. Thus, his vision of the future economy is one where society takes the form of one large trust, but because it will be run democratically by worker-citizens, it will pursue their interests. Bellamy\\\'s vision is a kind of syndicalism, in which a congress of industrial unions forms the core of the national government. Moreover, because the people of the future are so rational they organize their society along the most rational, and thus egalitarian, lines. This is why, for example, in Bellamy\\\'s utopia social classes are not abolished but re-organized on rational lines, which for him means according to age. This there is a course of age-based classes, or stages, all persons pass through. All the stages are designed to maximize the development of citizens\\\' personal talents and capacities, to effectively train people to be competent workers fit for important jobs, as well as to be active and engaged citizens. The application of reason to social problems results, in Bellamy\\\'s utopia, in progressive policies like equal educational and occupational opportunities for women; everyone must work between 21 and 45; universal basic education for all until 21; occupations decided, as much as possible, by aptitude; remuneration based on effort; college open to all, with admissions based on social need and individual merit; free universal healthcare. In keeping with his syndicalist vision, Bellamy\\\'s utopia has a political structure framed around industrial unions. Bellamy\\\'s novel envisions the future President of the United States as the general of the Industrial Army, and serving a five year term. This person is to be elected by a vote of all those worker-citizens who have retired, i.e. those over forty five years of age. In this utopia there would be ten industrial departments, or unions, each with its own head, or chief, elected by the retied members of the individual departments; the group of these chiefs serves as a kind of cabinet to the President. There is a national congress, which meets every five years to pass or revise laws. He proposes a separate entity he calls, the Inspectorate, to pursue consumer complaints, fraud, abuse, misconduct, et cetera . The job this agency is to seek out graft, inefficiency, or waste, as well as health, safety, or environmental hazards. The central metaphor of Bellamy\\\'s novel is presented in his analogy of the General and the Balloon. Dr. Leete in trying to explain the reasoning behind the organization of the society and economy of the future tells Julian, "It is easier for a general up in a balloon with perfect survey of the field, to manoeuvre a million men to victory then for a sergeant to mange a platoon in a thicket". [1] It is most rational to organize society into one big corporation because this will facilitate macro-level social and economic planning in the public interest. The idea is to harness the power of the large trusts, because their centralization afforded them a larger view of the economic landscape, and allows them to plan accordingly. Under capitalism this planning took the form of the great trusts trying to manage competition between oligopolists to keep prices and profits high. When all the nation\\\'s industries were organized under centralized control, like in a trust, and all these trusts nationalized, society would be able to engage in the kind of economic planning that can create the utopian society Julian West encounters. The idea for the Bellamy clubs emerged very soon after the novel debuted. A reporter in Boston, Cyrus Field Willard, is credited with coming up with idea, as there is a surviving letter in which he ask Bellamy for permission to found a club to promote Bellamy\\\'s ideas. Bellamy assented, and the ball began rolling. In the fall of 1888 Willard\\\'s "Nationalist Circle", merged with the independently organized "Boston Bellamy Club" of Charles E. Bower & Arthur F. Deveraux to found the first permanent Bellamyite group. The Bellamyite movement was at this point more a moral association than a political party. In 1889 they began publishing a magazine, The Nationalist . Groups were very quickly founded in large Eastern cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington D.C.. The movement was particularly strong in California. That state had sixty five local clubs, whereas, even a large and populous state like New York had only sixteen local Bellamyite groups. The early Bellamyite movement eschewed political action, that is, participation in a \\\'democratic\\\' political process they felt was rigged. They focused instead on propaganda, e.g. organizing public lectures, printing and distributing pamphlets and periodicals. As the fever pitch of labor and socialist militance and agitation, combined with events like the Great Strike of 1887 and the Homestead Strike of 1892, the Bellamyite movement reversed course and engaged furiously in political activity focused on more immediate gains, with a particular emphasis on the elections of 1892. The economic and political climate of the age created other reform minded groups in addition to Bellamyites, groups which would cooperate and compete with each other as they often had large segments of over-lapping memberships. Economic depression, political corruption, financial speculation and market manipulation, all fueled the rise of the Populist movement, and of the People\\\'s Party. Bellamy, and many other members of the Nationalist clubs were so supportive of the People\\\'s Party that eventually the Bellamyite movement merged into the Populist movement. The failure of Bellamy as a political candidate did not help the situation, as the alliance of the People\\\'s Party and the Bellamyites rendered most of the latter\\\'s organizational functions redundant. In the wake of the 1892 elections the Bellamyite movement began to dissipate as it was largely subsumed by the Populist movement. In early 1894 Bellamy\\\'s own journal, The New Nation , was forced to close due to financial difficulties. Later in this same year Bellamy ceased his political activity on behalf of the movement that bore his name. Other Bellamyite periodicals continued to be published over the next couple years, but in dwindling numbers. By 1896 there were only a handful of Bellamyite groups still active, for example those in Wisconsin which were organized enough to run candidates for state offices that year. After this, the Bellamyite movement basically vanishes as a movement, save for a scattering of die-hards. Bellamy himself would die only two years later, on May 22nd 1898. Though he claimed that he did not write his novel with the aim of providing an explicit plan of economic and political reform, his utopian vision of a more democratic, more equal future resonated deeply with a nation weary of the effects of capitalism. Political Utopias in Antebellum America The populist and reform movements of the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the socialist movement emerging in this era, had important precursors in American history. Indeed, the success of a radical utopian inspired movement like Bellamyism will not surprise one acquainted with the utopian movements of antebellum America. There was a very limited Owenite movement in America during the 1820s, the culmination of which was the experimental community at New Harmony, Indiana. Much more extensive and successful was the Fourierist movement that emerged in the 1840s. [2] This movement attracted a fairly large following, and was able to establish a number of experimental communities, called Phalanxes. In contrast to Bellamyism, which was an American movement, both Owenism and Fourierism are European movements which crossed the Atlantic. The success of Fourierism, and relative lack of success of Owenism, in transplanting to America is explained in part by the differences in the economic climates in which they came to America. Fourierism resonated more deeply with Americans than Owenism mostly because they were more open to radical utopian experiments in the wake of the economic crisis of 1837, and the depression that followed. If not for the economic crisis of 1873 and the ensuing depression, the 1886 Haymarket Affair, the Great Strike 1887, the crash of 1893 and the depression that followed, Bellamyism may not have emerged as a mass movement. One major difference between Owenism and Fourierism, and a factor in their respective levels of success, is in the manner of their transplantation to America. While Owenism was brought to America by Owen and his sons, Fourierism was brought back to America by an American disciple of Fourier\\\'s, Albert Brisbane. Owen purchased the town of New Harmony in Indiana from its previous occupants with the intention of founding a utopian community there based on his philosophic principles and the lessons learned in operating his mills at New Lanark in Scotland. American Fourierists began with editing Fourier\\\'s ideas into a coherent form, and then propagandizing on behalf of these ideas. When these agitation efforts combined with economic depression in the wake of 1837, with the lingering effects of the second Great Awakening, the example of successful utopian communities in America, and the sympathetic affinities of various immigrant groups Fourierism became a rather large movement. At its high point the Fourierist movement could boast of dozens of Phalanxes across America. Owenism The Owenite movement in America was comprised almost entirely of the experimental utopian community the movements\\\' founder Robert Owen established, and his efforts to acquire funding and attract personnel for this community. Though there were other Owenite communities in the U.S., the story of Owenism in America is largely the story of the New Harmony colony. Unfortunately, Owen found little success in America, less than some of the experiments within Great Britain, and his utopian experiment lasted only four years before the colonists abandoned the Owenite philosophy. The community at New Harmony persisted, but they were no longer an Owenite utopian project. Owen had originally purchased the land, and a few buildings, from the previous residents at New Harmony. These previous occupants were Rappites colonists, a mostly German Protestant religious sect, which had moved to Indiana from Pennsylvania to more freely practice their beliefs and communal way of life. After establishing the first group of settlers at his community, Owen left his son William in charge at New Harmony and returned east to find more funds and colonists for his project. When Owen returned in April of 1825 he found the community of several hundred residents in chaos. He did his best to put matters in order, and succeeded fairly well, he departed again in June 1825 in search of more funds and colonists. In all, Owen spent only a few months residing at New Harmony. Within two years of its founding as an Owenite utopian experiment the New Harmony community was an economic failure, that is, it was not financially or materially self-supporting. There are a host of reasons that account for the failure of the Owenite experiment at New Harmony. The colony had trouble attracting residents, and those who did come were not always of the highest caliber. While New Harmony did bring in many ideologically committed Owenites, it also welcomed in many types of people. In a letter, Robert Dale Owen, one of Robert\\\'s sons, describes the population of New Harmony as, "a heterogeneous collection of radicals, enthusiastic devotees to principle, honest latitudinarians, and lazy theorists, with a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in". [3] In another letter, William Owen, another of Robert\\\'s sons, says that besides committed Owenites, New Harmony had attracted, "crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town makes success unlikely". [4] There was a laundry list of complaints about why the New Harmony project failed; not enough skilled craftsmen; not enough unskilled laborers; insufficient and inexperienced management and supervision; not enough housing; not enough land; not enough privacy; too much freedom; not enough freedom. Robert Owen was often away from the colony and, like him, many colonists only stayed a few months. This high turnover, as well as the problems listed above, seemed to doom this project from the outset. Between the motley collection of colonists, the factional infighting, and the lack of economic viability, the New Harmony settlement ended as a failure for Owen. The lack of economic success and factional squabbles over questions of theoretical principles and practical organization led to a large schism at New Harmony in 1826. A group carried on the Owenite project for another couple years, but finally gave up the ghost in 1829. In 1827, Owen severed ties with the community he founded, transferring ownership to his sons. After 1829 the town abandoned Owenism, and converted their community to a traditional capitalist private property system. While the town was a failure as a utopian experiment, it did produce some very interesting and significant results and persons. Under Owenite leadership New Harmony could boast of the first free public library, and the first free public school. It also became a leading center of scientific discovery in the natural science, in particular in geology where Owen\\\'s third son David Dale achieved prominence. Robert Dale, the oldest son of Robert Owen, in addition to publishing many books and pamphlets, served in both the Indiana state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. He advocated for women\\\'s rights, for free public education, and opposed slavery. It was in fact Robert Dale Owen who introduced the bill which founded the now world famous Smithsonian Institution. Fourierism Like the Owenites, the practical activity of the Fourierist movement in America was directed towards the founding of utopian communities. In the minds of the Fourierists these communities, or rather the network of these communities, would form the basis of the new society, and the transformative effects would radiate out from these communities. Though the Fourierists did much to expound and promulgate their theories in writing, their main energy was directed at founding and linking Fourierist phalanxes. A working example of their vision of a utopian way of life would, in their estimation, be the best piece of propaganda they could have. An operational model Phalanx was more likely to attract actual converts than hundreds of pounds of printed literature. One quite decisive advantage of the Fourierists was that they, unlike Owen, were not intensely skeptical. Indeed, the embrace of religious arguments, appeals to religious morality, and the use of religious modes of presenting Fourierist ideas very much helped Fourierism gain a large following in America. The Fourierist movement was more successful than the Owenite movement in America, and thus it was larger and more diverse. It was however, more distant in its ideology and practice from its founder than the Owenite movement was from Owen. The experience of the movement is not so directly tied to any one individual community. This movement was, like Owenism, short-lived, despite many Fourierists being intensely passionate. Albert Brisbane, an American traveling in Europe, became a votary of Charles Fourier and his utopian socialist philosophy. In the early 1830s Brisbane returned to America and eagerly set to work proselytizing for Fourier\\\'s ideas; edited and parsed by Brisbane for American audiences. By 1840 he was publishing The Phalanx , a Fourierist journal, but his big break came in 1842 when Horace Greeley allowed Brisbane to purchase a front-page column in his popular newspaper The New York Tribune . This platform allowed Brisbane to bring Fourier\\\'s ideas to the huge audience of the Tribune \\\'s readership. Running for about a year and a half, and reprinted in dozens of other newspapers, Brisbane\\\'s column, helped ignite the spark of the American Fourierist movement. We should note that Brisbane was not alone in working to advance Fourier\\\'s ideas in America, nor was his journal the only Fourierist publication, though it was among the earliest. Over the next decade, Fourierist phalanxes sprung up across the country, perhaps the most famous of which was the Brook Farm community in Massachusetts. The organized Fourierist movement established at least thirty phalanxes, and at it height, the movement consisted of perhaps as many as fifty Fourierist communities. One must be cognizant that there were several strains of Fourierism in America, and so deciding which communities count as Fourierist can sometimes be a matter of debate. The "phalanx" was the name Fourier gave to his ideal utopian communities. They were largely agricultural, but did not reject machinery. They were designed to self-sustaining communities in which all participants would have a chance to prosper. Fourier\\\'s phalanxes were not communist, since they were supposed to contain inequalities, that is, individuals were to be rewarded both for their effort as well as their contribution of capital. By the mid-1850s however, all but a hardy few phalanxes remained. What few did survive the collapse of the movement, were wiped out by the Civil war. Most Fourierist phalanxes lasted, on average, only a couple years; indeed, critics labeled Fourierists, \\\'four-year-ites\\\'. The longest lasting community was the North American Phalanx of Colts Neck, New Jersey, which was in continuous operation for twelve years. There is one very important way that the experience of the Brook Farm community was characteristic of the larger Fourierist movement. The Brook Farm community was originally established as a utopian community by Transcendentalist-inspired reformers. In the spring of 1841 George Ripley, and a small coterie of fellows, decamped to Brook Farm and established an experimental utopian community. Their aims were to counter the effects of a depersonalized and unequal society by removing themselves from that society, and forming a more ideal communal way of life. The Brook Farmers rejected Emerson\\\'s more individualistic, more isolationist, vision of Transcendentalist "self-culture". After four years of disorganization, factional quibbles, and lack of a cohesive vision, inhibiting the communities\\\' prosperity, the Brook Farmers decided to adopt Fourierism in1844 because it offered a more concrete plan and structure. This is what attracted many, beyond Transcendentalists, to Fourier\\\'s system, and to Fourierist phalanxes, in this era. It was a detailed plan of action for forming communities in an age when so many utopian schemes were vague and ill-defined. The Fourierist movement, brief as its life may have been, as well as the legacy of its example, made important contributions to later American political movements. Several important legacies of the Fourierist movement stand out. First, in the 1840s the Fourierists were among the earliest and strongest critics of the nascent industrial capitalist order. The Fourierists criticized capitalism as an anti-democratic system of "industrial feudalism" which subordinated workers to employers. Fourierism, and indeed the whole communitarian movement, achieved its prominence at a kind of tipping point in American history, and its failure to stop the advance of the burgeoning industrial capitalism set American society on different path than had this movement had more success. On a longer view, the legacy of the Fourierist movement continued to be seen in the communitarian aspects of the American socialist movement, as well as in the American labor movement, especially in its advocacy of producers\\\' and consumers\\\' cooperatives. The Fourierist movement has an additional interesting legacy in the way that it influenced the thinking of Edward Bellamy. Indeed, several important elements of Fourierist philosophy appear in Bellamy\\\'s utopia. Conclusion The utopian alternative was very much alive in 19th-century America. The threat various utopian movements constituted can be seen in the sheer numbers of people who flocked to religious or secular utopian communities all over the country. From the 1820s through the 1850s thousands and thousands of Americans experimented with utopianism, joining one or another experimental community. Over these decades nearly one hundred different utopian communities and projects were launched in America. Some lasted just a few months, others only a few years. Others, however, enjoyed some longevity. In general, the utopian communities that tended to last longer were the religiously inspired ones, which also very often had the advantage of being ethno-religious groupings. Many utopian groups like the Rappites or Harmonists, the Amish, and the Hutterites, were largely German Protestant sects. Though there were religious groups, e.g. the Shakers, who were successful at converting many different kinds of people to their way of life. Other utopian groups attempted to create new religions, e.g. the Mormons, and the Oneida community. In a fairly common pattern, people turned to utopian communities when economic hardship became most acute, and then left when conditions improved. The very existence of alternative, non-for-profit, ways of living posed a threat to the nascent capitalist order in America. It was only in the decades after the Civil war that most kinds of utopian communities became economically unviable as corporate consolidation, mechanization of production, and economies of scale replaced durable hand-made goods with cheaper but less durable factory-made goods. Utopian communities, as small-scale industrial producers of craft goods could simply not compete. Though many of these communities continued to be self-sufficient and survived as communities, their prosperity at first slowly, and then rather quickly, diminished, making attracting new followers and maintaining their communities difficult. What the experience of utopian communities, both religious and secular, testifies to is the ability of possibility to capture the imagination, and to inspire action. Their many different aims and principles notwithstanding, these utopian movements all sought to transform the lives of human beings through radically transforming social relations. Beyond utopian experiments in communal living, utopian thinking provided some inspiration for more practical movements like the early women\\\'s suffrage movement, the abolitionist movement, and the prohibitionist movement. The Occupy movement, brief but spectacular, is part of this utopian tradition in American history. Its memory is worth preserving, its anniversaries worth noting, because of the utopian aspect of its existence. Even for a brief time, just as with our 19th century forebears, a utopian political movement allowed a great many people the freedom to participate in the dream that a better world is possible, to experience the thrill of feeling that such a possible better world could be realized.

In theory, it provides a perfect system of government, an abundance of opportunities, and fair distribution of resources. Below are some potential privileges and benefits that people might experience in a Utopian society: Free Healthcare: In a Utopian society, healthcare would be free, ensuring that everyone has access to adequate care without financial hardship. Free Education: Education would be accessible and free, empowering people with knowledge, skills, and critical thinking to make informed decisions. Guaranteed Basic Income: Everyone would be guaranteed a basic income, ensuring that everyone has the resources they need to survive and thrive. Freedom of Expression: Utopian societies would allow freedom of expression, where people are free to worship, vote, criticize and hold different beliefs without fear of persecution. Clean Environment: The environment would be clean and protected, allowing people to enjoy nature and live in harmony with it. Equal Opportunities: Everyone would have equal access to opportunities, including employment, housing, education, and healthcare. Peaceful Coexistence: Utopian society would be free from crime, war, and violence, ensuring that people can live in peace and harmony with each other. Shared Responsibility: In a utopian society, everyone would take collective responsibility for the sustainability and maintenance of their community, leading to a sense of shared purpose and fulfillment. It is essential to note that achieving a utopian society is an ideal that may be difficult to achieve in practice, but striving towards it can help create a society with more equity, justice, and sustainability.\'}, {\'title\': \'Building a Utopia: Achieving a Society Through Social Democratic ...\', \'url\': \'https://socialistcurrents.org/?p=4833\', \'content\': \'By Allen Coleman In a world plagued by war, inequality, and injustice, the idea of a utopian society where these issues are obsolete may seem far-fetched. However, the principles of social democracy offer a realistic and achievable path to such a society. Imagine a world where war is unheard of, where human dignity is upheld, and where the needs of the people are met through the collective value placed on labor. In this world, the government exists solely to serve the working class, and the workers themselves play a pivotal role in shaping the future. This is the vision of a social democratic utopia—an ideal rooted in equity, cooperation, and respect for human dignity. The Foundational Principles of Social Democracy At the heart of social democracy lies a commitment to economic justice, democratic participation, and equality under the law. These principles provide the foundation for a system that ensures everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background or social status. Economic Justice Economic justice is the cornerstone of a social democratic society. The goal is to create a system where the wealth generated by society is distributed fairly. This can be achieved through progressive taxation, where those who have more contribute more to the common good. In addition, social safety nets such as universal healthcare, free education, and affordable housing ensure that basic needs are met for everyone, regardless of their financial situation. In such a system, no one is left behind, and every person can contribute meaningfully to society without fear of poverty or deprivation. Democratic Participation A defining feature of social democracy is the active participation of citizens in the political process. In a social democratic utopia, governance is not limited to elected officials but is instead a collective endeavor. Workers are empowered to participate in decision-making at all levels, from local councils to national policy. This is achieved through strong labor unions, workplace democracy, and public participation in government through mechanisms like participatory budgeting and citizen assemblies. These processes ensure that the voices of the working class are not only heard but are central to the decision-making that shapes society. Rule of Law and Equality A just society is one where the rule of law applies equally to all people. In a social democratic utopia, equality before the law is paramount. Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or social class has no place in such a society. The government upholds civil rights and ensures that the legal system is fair, transparent, and accessible to everyone. This creates a foundation of trust and respect between the government and its citizens, fostering a sense of shared purpose and commitment to the common good. Steps to Transition into a Social Democratic Society Transitioning to a social democratic society requires significant reforms in both the economic and political spheres, as well as a cultural shift in how people view labor, government, and community. Economic Transformation One of the first steps in realizing a social democratic utopia is to transform the economy. This includes promoting cooperative enterprises, worker-owned businesses, and shared ownership models where the benefits of labor are equitably distributed. In such a system, wealth is not concentrated in the hands of a few, but is instead shared among the people who contribute to its creation. Wealth redistribution mechanisms, such as progressive taxation and social safety nets, ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need to live a dignified life. Political Reform Political reform is equally essential to creating a social democratic utopia. A political system based on proportional representation ensures that all voices are heard and that no single group can dominate the political landscape. Campaign finance reforms are necessary to limit the influence of corporations and wealthy elites, ensuring that government policy is shaped by the will of the people rather than corporate interests. By limiting the power of money in politics, social democracy empowers ordinary citizens to shape the future of their society. Cultural Shift A cultural shift is also necessary to make the vision of a social democratic utopia a reality. People must come to recognize the intrinsic value of labor, not just as a means of personal gain, but as a way to contribute to the common good. Education plays a critical role in fostering this mindset. A robust education system that promotes critical thinking, civic engagement, and empathy can help instill values of cooperation, solidarity, and respect for all members of society. The Role of Government in Serving the Working Class In a social democratic utopia, the government’s role is to serve the needs of the working class. This means that policies must prioritize the rights and well-being of workers, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and the right to organize and collectively bargain. The government also invests heavily in public infrastructure, ensuring that healthcare, education, and transportation are accessible to all, regardless of income. Moreover, the government must be adaptive and responsive to the needs of the people. By using participatory budgeting and citizen assemblies, the government can ensure that policies reflect the priorities and concerns of the population. In such a society, the government is not an external force imposing its will on the people, but a servant of the people, working to create a society that reflects their collective values. Challenges and How to Address Them While the vision of a social democratic utopia is compelling, there are significant challenges toovercome. One of the most significant challenges is resistance from powerful elites who benefit from the current system of inequality. To address this, social democratic movements must build strong coalitions among grassroots organizations, workers, and progressive groups to counteract the influence of the wealthy few. Another challenge is the pressure of globalization, which often favors multinational corporations over national governments. However, social democratic countries can work together to promote international solidarity, creating a global network of cooperation that transcends borders. Finally, maintaining the integrity of the system is crucial. Social democracies must establish strong checks and balances to prevent the concentration of power and avoid authoritarian tendencies. By continually adapting to the needs of the people and ensuring that power remains in the hands of the many rather than the few, social democracies can safeguard their values of equality, justice, and democracy. The Benefits of a Social Democratic Utopia The benefits of a social democratic utopia are profound. First and foremost, such a society would eliminate the need for war. By fostering global cooperation and prioritizing diplomacy over militarization, conflict becomes a relic of the past. Furthermore, a social democratic society would foster thriving communities where people’s basic needs are met, and poverty is eradicated. The resulting sense of security and shared purpose would allow individuals to lead fulfilling lives, contributing meaningfully to society while enjoying a high quality of life. Ultimately, a social democratic utopia is a society where personal fulfillment and collective well-being are not in competition but are seen as mutually reinforcing. In this world, every person is valued, every voice matters, and every person has the opportunity to contribute to the common good.

Alas, afraid of how the world is evolving; eager to keep for ourselves what we have; willing to preserve the certainties that we have built in our heads; enticed by a new philosophy where we are supposed to maximise happiness — we continue to resist and reject change. Why embrace the future if it is this painful? Why become aware that our world is collapsing? To avoid a growing sense of helplessness and despair, we then run faster towards that light at the end of the tunnel. Instead of embracing the unknown, we become even more blinded by what we think we know. Companies only learn agility in order to increase productivity, grow their revenues and make more profit. Governments engage in stakeholder consultations but their conclusions, coincidentally, always happen to confirm the initial intentions of those in power. People are concerned about plastic in our oceans but they ignore why this issue has become so salient. We change in order to remain the same and this is not good enough to meet today’s challenges. As Einstein wrote in 1946, “A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.” Utopian rationality In my teaching, I invite executives and directors to become smarter than rational. I do not propose to throw out rationality. Rather, I want to overcome a rationality that imposes itself upon a complex reality in a totalitarian fashion. To identify a goal, choose the best action to reach it, then measure the consequences and finally claim success once the task is done is not smart enough. In a world full of surprises, we need to dream beyond our goals if they are to have meaning. A sense of purpose is essential for long-term value creation, as the dream that drives our goals will ensure the relevance of work beyond the next quarter or business cycle. We also need to realise that we may not attain our goals, and that can be an opportunity because they may need to be changed. We should never be prisoners of our goals. Anchored in our values, we can appreciate where we are at present and have our eyes fully open. Instead of serving a system that is at risk of destroying our humanity, we should make sure to put the framework of rationality to the service of our values and dreams. It is also a powerful strategic exercise. At INSEAD, my experience is that the building of a utopia allows executives and directors to free their minds from confining intellectual prejudices. The method draws from the three core principles of Wise Power: duality of mind, emotional maturity and generosity of soul. It is a way of thinking, feeling and dreaming that enhances our ability to meet the world half-way. It is especially useful for important and difficult decisions. Wise power consists of the ability to face surprising, even unpleasant truths bravely and honestly, although they may directly contradict our firmly held beliefs and preferences. Wise leaders are much less susceptible to the fear of the unknown that underlies defensiveness, because they perceive the deeper dynamics of the landscape around them. Instead of being fixated on the light at the end of the tunnel, they learn to pause and see that the tunnel is in fact made of beautiful trees, each of which is also a door to another space where they can discover, learn or just be. How to generate a utopia? Now more than ever, strategic business decisions must be taken in light of other realms of power. It is thus essential that utopias encompass the political, social, technological and natural spheres, as well as business. This allows leaders to embrace the growing expectations of multiple stakeholders across myriad issues. Complex, ambiguous grey zones have a perfect right to exist in these utopias. For example, you do not have to choose between business having freedom to operate, and governments possessing scope to regulate – you can have both. As participants present their utopias in class, it is liberating for them to express these contradictions. Executives are typically constrained in a discourse where business interests dictate everything. However, they are also citizens eager to exist more fully and freely at work. As they share their utopias and listen to others’, they become conscious of common predominant themes: a form of social equality, a government that cares for the common good, technology at the service of humans and not the other way around, and harmony with nature, among others. These commonalities transform what might have seemed an exercise in fanciful idealism into something highly relevant to the everyday exercise of executive power. The unthinkable suddenly becomes almost feasible. The lines between utopianism and executives’ habitual “realism” begin to blur. Why utopia? Peel back the layers of realism, and you will often find cynicism and pessimism feeding fear a steady diet of rationalisation, e.g. the world is so corrupt, boldly engaging with it is useless. Some cynicism and pessimism can also be valuable. Life is not black and white -- and we also need to tame some messianic tendencies that bring us back to the authoritarian form of leadership that we want to transform. , in terms of what could be. It gives us the courage and confidence to see the distance between reality and our dreams as a space of opportunity rather than ipso facto defeat. Applications of utopia Utopian thinking can be open-ended, but it can also be tailored to address specific business problems. I have used it to find solutions for a multinational energy company facing a disastrous situation. The company was heavily criticised in the media for its role in the environmental devastation and worsening quality of life of local communities. In response to being painted as villains in the press, executives had adopted a stance of denial of their responsibility. Their relationships with community leaders and government officials were at an impasse. By inviting participants to conceive of the best resolution imaginable for such conflicts, we foster within them an appetite for the unknown. They start envisioning ways to use their companies’ wealth and power for mutual value creation, together with locals on the ground. Most importantly, they become more aware of the pitfalls of a confrontational non-market strategy. Instead of maintaining the belief that they can save the world if they become a force for good (another way to remain in the ego-driven authoritarian form of leadership), companies can cultivate a global vision in which they interact with other forms of power in a more respectful and harmonious manner. Imagining utopias can also be useful for established organisations in the midst of market flux. For instance, a session on utopian thinking applied to the future of mobility allowed executives of a car manufacturer to better appreciate the multiple facets and layers of their situation. Rather than being constrained by the established discourse and culture of their company, they could engage at different levels and discuss the deeper changes driving the shifts in their industry. They were developing a sense of where they stood within this larger ecosystem and could find new levers to shape their culture and their identity. Instead of nurturing fear and helplessness, their uncertain future provided meaning. Developing utopia You do not need to wait for other people to apply utopian thinking. You can start yourself as an individual. Just think of a high-level challenge facing your organisation, industry, or even the nation or region in which you do business. Then apply your imagination to the problem, working through the different perspectives of the relevant stakeholders. Do not fear contradictions and allow space for the commonalities of good intentions and diversity of values. As a transformation of your own mind-set, the exercise will teach you to fear less and embrace more. You can scale up the benefit by involving your team – sharing your ideas with them and adding their contributions until a collective utopia emerges. This dream will help you select your objectives and identify the key stakeholders that can help you. It will also change your attitude to the world. Less afraid to envision change, you will look for opportunities to contribute to a better world beyond strict business objectives.\'}, {\'title\': \'The Value of Utopia: The American Tradition of Radical Utopianism ...\', \'url\': \'https://www.hamptonthink.org/read/the-value-of-utopia-the-american-tradition-of-radical-utopianism\', \'content\': \'By Nick Partyka For many centuries persons, peoples, and civilizations, have dreamed about what an ideal society (utopia) would look like, and worried about ways in which society could be much worse (dystopia). Utopian dreams and dystopian worries are powerful tools for thinking about what sorts of changes a society should pursue or avoid, and what underlying dynamics these proposed changes expose. This series examines the tradition of utopian and dystopian thought in western culture, beginning with the ancient Greeks, but continuing on into the modern period. Our focus in this series will be on the important social, political, and economic ideas and issues raised in different utopian stories. When we look into utopian stories, and their historical times, what we\\\'ll see reflected in the stories of utopia are the social, political, and economic concerns of the authors, their societies, and or their particular social class. The meaning of the word \\\'utopia\\\' comes to us from ancient Greece. In our modern world the word takes its current form because of Thomas More\\\'s 1516 book of the same name. Indeed, it is this book from which most of the modern western European utopian tradition takes its origin; or at least, this work inaugurates its most common trope. Where we have in our lexicon one \\\'utopia\\\', the Greeks had two. The difference, even confusion, between them marks an essential cleavage. For the Greeks, there was both Eu- topia, and Ou-topia. Both are derived in part from the Greek word topos , which means "place", and the suffix \\\' ia \\\' meaning land. Translated into English, \\\'Ou-topia\\\' means something like, " No-place land", whereas \\\'Eu-topia\\\' translates as "good-place land". More succinctly, the difference is between the idea of the best place, and an impossible place. It is the difference between a place which does not exist, because it has not yet been realized, and a place which cannot, and could not, ever exist. Our modern word is pronounced as the Greeks pronounced \\\'Eutopia\\\'. However, the meanings of these Greek words were confused by modern writers, who ended up with the spelling \\\'utopia\\\', from the old English \\\'Utopie\\\' as opposed to "Eutopia", as meaning "good place". This basic confusion about utopias, between "good place" and "no place", inserts an important ambiguity directly in the center of thinking about utopias. This ambiguity forces one to wonder of utopian writers, Are their visions supposed to be dreams of possible futures meant to incite us to action, or are they impossible dreams meant as reminders that the world is not easily re-shaped by human effort? Is a utopia supposed to be a good place or a no-place? Is the author supporting or condemning the practices of the fictional societies they describe? One qualification must be made right away. A utopia is not a paradise. There is a colloquial usage of \\\'utopia\\\' and \\\'utopian\\\' that seem to suggest that it is a paradise. And compared to the societies in which actual humans lives, many of the fictional utopias would have indeed been seen as paradises, relatively speaking. However, we must draw a technical distinction between a paradise or a golden-age, and a utopia. In a paradise or golden-age no work and no effort are required by humans to obtain the things they want and need. Perhaps the most famous golden-age many are familiar with would be the Biblical Garden of Eden. Another well-known paradise is described in the mid-14th century poem The Land of Cockaigne , where fully cooked turkey legs literally fly through the air and into one\\\'s mouth. In this place the only effort one need put in is to chew. The whole idea of a Cockaigne, or a paradise, is that everything one would ever need is abundantly supplied without any effort. The natural world is just so constructed - either at random or by design - that there springs forth automatically an abundance of everything necessary for everyone, all the time, always. In this kind of society, or world, there never arises anything resembling what we - or most societies in the history of our world - call a political problem. Everyone has enough of everything. So there is no cause for argument. There is no inequality, because everyone has everything everyone else has. Or at least, everyone has access to just as much of what others have whenever they would like it. In this kind of world what causes could there be for strife, or for civil war? A paradise, or a golden-age, is thus totally non-political, and not terribly interesting. What this means is that utopias are enough like our own condition, our own world, that we can take inspiration from them. They are enough like the social conditions we know that we can learn lessons for and about ourselves and our societies by examining at them. This is exactly what makes utopias so interesting. As we will see, utopian literature has a long, very long, history with human beings. The enduring appeal of and, interest in utopias testifies to their relevance. This is the reason that we too are looking at utopias. We are all concerned with, or at least we are all effected by, the way our society is organized. By looking at how other ideal societies might be organized we can explore the merits, and demerits of various kinds of social institutions, and of the various ways of structuring those institutions. We are concerned to change our own society, and utopias allow us to think about the direction of that change. We have a colloquial usage of the word \\\'utopia\\\' and \\\'utopian\\\' in contemporary society that works to prohibit much creative thought, and dismisses utopian thought as feckless, and as such, worthless. Part of the aims of this series is to demonstrate the value of this "worthless" endeavor. Dreaming, far from idle, far from impotent, is essential. Without wonder, without questions, the human imagination will atrophy. The value of utopia is that thinking about utopias allows us to both critique present societies, and also to articulate a vision of how we\\\'d like our societies to be different. The deeper value of utopian thinking is that it sets us free, free to speculate and more importantly to give expression to our striving, to our desire for a better world. Everything human beings can be must first be dreamed by human beings. This is the value of utopia and dystopia. Thus, the first pre-requisite for this series is the rejection of this colloquial notion of utopia and the utopian. Dismissed from the start, it will not be a surprise if we fail to learn anything from our utopian traditions. Introduction Brief, but spectacular. That is how I think of the Occupy movement. An article I read recently lamented that the anniversaries of this movement seem to come and go now with but a murmur, a faint echo of the voice that all too briefly seemed capable of shaking American society out of complacency, of opening up new possibilities. There have by now been enough autopsies of this movement, and its failures, that there is no need for another. One thing that stands out is of course the fact that the movement never coalesced around a set of demands, never formulated a coherent political programme. Whether or not the Occupy movement did a good job distilling its critique, and its vision, neither were sufficiently theoretically developed or promulgated. Occupy in many senses seem to try to be a leaderless and theory-less movement. Of course, the main reason for the end of the Occupy movement was the physical clearance of the encampments by the thugs of the ruling class, that is, the police. Much more fruitfully, when we look to the practice of Occupy, and the many encampments around the country, and indeed around the world, we can see that there is certainly a clear political, and moral ethos animating the activity and structure of the movement. What emerged from the Occupy encampments was an ethos of self-organization, free association, of de-centralized participatory democracy, and non-market modes of distribution. In Occupy encampments around the country people organized themselves to provide many kinds of basic, and some more advanced, services and community infrastructure, e.g. free meals, free educational opportunities, free healthcare, and much more. The diversity of services offered by different Occupy encampments was truly an amazing display of cooperation, solidarity, and self-organization. And indeed, this is what was really threatening about the occupy movement, it offered a robust vision of a more participatory, more solidaristic form of community, and worked diligently to create this, first within the bounds of its camps, and then the communities around the camps. Building up a vision of a new society, and a physical representation of that vision, became a major challenge to the ruling class because of the speed with which this movement grew and gathered strength. Occupy was not the first time "utopian" ideas of more democratic, more participatory, more egalitarian, forms of community captured the imagination of Americans, and threatened the ruling class by becoming a movement. This has happened several times in our history, but, as one might expect, these lie outside the mainstream narrative of U.S. history. Thankfully, in the wake of Howard Zinn, much work has been done to recover and disseminate the knowledge and memory of the existence of radicals and revolutionaries, not to mention their important role, in American history. Utopian ideas, and vision of better societies have captured the imagination of Americans, and become large movements more than once. These largely forgotten episodes include the Bellamyite movement in the 1890s, and the Fourierist movement of the 1840s. These latter two represent the more secular and political end of the spectrum of utopian experiments in American history. Looking Backwards, on Bellamyism While it is almost totally forgotten now, at the end of the 19th century, the only American works of fiction to sell more copies than Edward Bellamy\\\'s Looking Backwards were Uncle Tom\\\'s Cabin , and Ben-Hur . His book, and the ideas and vision contained in it, was so wildly popular that is spawned an intense, but short-lived political movement in the form of Bellamyite "Nationalist Clubs"; indeed they were often called "Bellamy Clubs". These clubs arose quickly following the release of Bellamy\\\'s novel, and while the first club originated in Boston, chapters soon popped up in cities across the nation. These clubs, via coordinated activity, became a political force as a movement in the first half of the last decade of the nineteenth century, before disappearing after merging with the Populist movement. They turned Bellamy himself into a politician, although he was perhaps not well suited to the role of leader of a socialist political movement. When Looking Backward was published in 1888 its popularity owed much to its readability, engaging narrative, but especially to its grand vision of a utopian future. Another big part of its popularity was conditioned by the times in which its author lived. Over the course of Edward Bellamy\\\'s forty-eight years he saw a great deal of turmoil, indeed, he would have been around fifteen the year the Civil war ended, and not quite twenty five when the Long Depression began in 1873. After the war American society experienced the rise of giant integrated capitalist firms - the infamous trusts - to positions of monopoly power; it had experienced a series of sometimes devastating economic recessions and depressions; it was experiencing increasing labor militance and strikes, for example the Great Strike of 1887; in conjunction with the latter, there was much radical socialist political agitation, see for example the 1886 Haymarket Affair and its highly controversial aftermath. Over this time the social effects of capitalism and industrialization became more pronounced. As is the still the case, it was workers, and the poor who bore the costs of material "progress". From the end of the Civil war to the turn of the century was when American capitalism really came into its own, when it rose to social and political dominance. As material prosperity of society increased, it looked to increasingly many Americans that, economically and politically, the decked was stacked against them, and that the lion\\\'s share of these gains were being accumulated by the wealthy. Bellamy adopts the Rip Van Winkle trope and has his protagonist fall asleep in then present-day 1887, and wake up over a century later in the year 2000. Bellamy\\\'s hero, Julian West, finds himself in a utopian future society in which the evils of the world of 1887 have been rectified through application of reason, science, and technology. The book takes the form of a kind of guided tour of the future given to Julian by his host, a Dr. Leete, who is caring for Julian after he wakes up. Dr. Leete and his family take turns escorting Julian around, showing him different aspects of the future, and answering his many questions about how the world of the future works, and how things came to be that way. Long story short, the Unites States of the future has been transformed by a rational and irresistible bloodless revolution into a socialist utopia, as one giant national trust, operated for the public benefit. All industries have been nationalized, and are democratically controlled by their workers; there is centralized distribution of important goods; there is gender equality; the economy has been reorganized as a rational and egalitarian "Industrial Army". As Bellamy describes this future, there are no wars, no government, no bankers, no corruption, no jails, and no more "buying" and "selling". The social revolution that brings about the society of the future, as Bellamy presents it, occurs much like Marx describes. The revolution is a natural occurrence, and as such irresistible, that happened once society developed to a certain level of rationality. Once people become sufficiently rational they simply perceive the need to radically transform society, and then do so in the form of a revolutionary mass social movement that peacefully takes power and then restructures society. Bellamy, like many of his age, was not keen to abandon the benefits of industrialization, and mass production, but wanted to change the composition and distribution of what is produced. Thus, his vision of the future economy is one where society takes the form of one large trust, but because it will be run democratically by worker-citizens, it will pursue their interests. Bellamy\\\'s vision is a kind of syndicalism, in which a congress of industrial unions forms the core of the national government. Moreover, because the people of the future are so rational they organize their society along the most rational, and thus egalitarian, lines. This is why, for example, in Bellamy\\\'s utopia social classes are not abolished but re-organized on rational lines, which for him means according to age. This there is a course of age-based classes, or stages, all persons pass through. All the stages are designed to maximize the development of citizens\\\' personal talents and capacities, to effectively train people to be competent workers fit for important jobs, as well as to be active and engaged citizens. The application of reason to social problems results, in Bellamy\\\'s utopia, in progressive policies like equal educational and occupational opportunities for women; everyone must work between 21 and 45; universal basic education for all until 21; occupations decided, as much as possible, by aptitude; remuneration based on effort; college open to all, with admissions based on social need and individual merit; free universal healthcare. In keeping with his syndicalist vision, Bellamy\\\'s utopia has a political structure framed around industrial unions. Bellamy\\\'s novel envisions the future President of the United States as the general of the Industrial Army, and serving a five year term. This person is to be elected by a vote of all those worker-citizens who have retired, i.e. those over forty five years of age. In this utopia there would be ten industrial departments, or unions, each with its own head, or chief, elected by the retied members of the individual departments; the group of these chiefs serves as a kind of cabinet to the President. There is a national congress, which meets every five years to pass or revise laws. He proposes a separate entity he calls, the Inspectorate, to pursue consumer complaints, fraud, abuse, misconduct, et cetera . The job this agency is to seek out graft, inefficiency, or waste, as well as health, safety, or environmental hazards. The central metaphor of Bellamy\\\'s novel is presented in his analogy of the General and the Balloon. Dr. Leete in trying to explain the reasoning behind the organization of the society and economy of the future tells Julian, "It is easier for a general up in a balloon with perfect survey of the field, to manoeuvre a million men to victory then for a sergeant to mange a platoon in a thicket". [1] It is most rational to organize society into one big corporation because this will facilitate macro-level social and economic planning in the public interest. The idea is to harness the power of the large trusts, because their centralization afforded them a larger view of the economic landscape, and allows them to plan accordingly. Under capitalism this planning took the form of the great trusts trying to manage competition between oligopolists to keep prices and profits high. When all the nation\\\'s industries were organized under centralized control, like in a trust, and all these trusts nationalized, society would be able to engage in the kind of economic planning that can create the utopian society Julian West encounters. The idea for the Bellamy clubs emerged very soon after the novel debuted. A reporter in Boston, Cyrus Field Willard, is credited with coming up with idea, as there is a surviving letter in which he ask Bellamy for permission to found a club to promote Bellamy\\\'s ideas. Bellamy assented, and the ball began rolling. In the fall of 1888 Willard\\\'s "Nationalist Circle", merged with the independently organized "Boston Bellamy Club" of Charles E. Bower & Arthur F. Deveraux to found the first permanent Bellamyite group. The Bellamyite movement was at this point more a moral association than a political party. In 1889 they began publishing a magazine, The Nationalist . Groups were very quickly founded in large Eastern cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington D.C.. The movement was particularly strong in California. That state had sixty five local clubs, whereas, even a large and populous state like New York had only sixteen local Bellamyite groups. The early Bellamyite movement eschewed political action, that is, participation in a \\\'democratic\\\' political process they felt was rigged. They focused instead on propaganda, e.g. organizing public lectures, printing and distributing pamphlets and periodicals. As the fever pitch of labor and socialist militance and agitation, combined with events like the Great Strike of 1887 and the Homestead Strike of 1892, the Bellamyite movement reversed course and engaged furiously in political activity focused on more immediate gains, with a particular emphasis on the elections of 1892. The economic and political climate of the age created other reform minded groups in addition to Bellamyites, groups which would cooperate and compete with each other as they often had large segments of over-lapping memberships. Economic depression, political corruption, financial speculation and market manipulation, all fueled the rise of the Populist movement, and of the People\\\'s Party. Bellamy, and many other members of the Nationalist clubs were so supportive of the People\\\'s Party that eventually the Bellamyite movement merged into the Populist movement. The failure of Bellamy as a political candidate did not help the situation, as the alliance of the People\\\'s Party and the Bellamyites rendered most of the latter\\\'s organizational functions redundant. In the wake of the 1892 elections the Bellamyite movement began to dissipate as it was largely subsumed by the Populist movement. In early 1894 Bellamy\\\'s own journal, The New Nation , was forced to close due to financial difficulties. Later in this same year Bellamy ceased his political activity on behalf of the movement that bore his name. Other Bellamyite periodicals continued to be published over the next couple years, but in dwindling numbers. By 1896 there were only a handful of Bellamyite groups still active, for example those in Wisconsin which were organized enough to run candidates for state offices that year. After this, the Bellamyite movement basically vanishes as a movement, save for a scattering of die-hards. Bellamy himself would die only two years later, on May 22nd 1898. Though he claimed that he did not write his novel with the aim of providing an explicit plan of economic and political reform, his utopian vision of a more democratic, more equal future resonated deeply with a nation weary of the effects of capitalism. Political Utopias in Antebellum America The populist and reform movements of the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the socialist movement emerging in this era, had important precursors in American history. Indeed, the success of a radical utopian inspired movement like Bellamyism will not surprise one acquainted with the utopian movements of antebellum America. There was a very limited Owenite movement in America during the 1820s, the culmination of which was the experimental community at New Harmony, Indiana. Much more extensive and successful was the Fourierist movement that emerged in the 1840s. [2] This movement attracted a fairly large following, and was able to establish a number of experimental communities, called Phalanxes. In contrast to Bellamyism, which was an American movement, both Owenism and Fourierism are European movements which crossed the Atlantic. The success of Fourierism, and relative lack of success of Owenism, in transplanting to America is explained in part by the differences in the economic climates in which they came to America. Fourierism resonated more deeply with Americans than Owenism mostly because they were more open to radical utopian experiments in the wake of the economic crisis of 1837, and the depression that followed. If not for the economic crisis of 1873 and the ensuing depression, the 1886 Haymarket Affair, the Great Strike 1887, the crash of 1893 and the depression that followed, Bellamyism may not have emerged as a mass movement. One major difference between Owenism and Fourierism, and a factor in their respective levels of success, is in the manner of their transplantation to America. While Owenism was brought to America by Owen and his sons, Fourierism was brought back to America by an American disciple of Fourier\\\'s, Albert Brisbane. Owen purchased the town of New Harmony in Indiana from its previous occupants with the intention of founding a utopian community there based on his philosophic principles and the lessons learned in operating his mills at New Lanark in Scotland. American Fourierists began with editing Fourier\\\'s ideas into a coherent form, and then propagandizing on behalf of these ideas. When these agitation efforts combined with economic depression in the wake of 1837, with the lingering effects of the second Great Awakening, the example of successful utopian communities in America, and the sympathetic affinities of various immigrant groups Fourierism became a rather large movement. At its high point the Fourierist movement could boast of dozens of Phalanxes across America. Owenism The Owenite movement in America was comprised almost entirely of the experimental utopian community the movements\\\' founder Robert Owen established, and his efforts to acquire funding and attract personnel for this community. Though there were other Owenite communities in the U.S., the story of Owenism in America is largely the story of the New Harmony colony. Unfortunately, Owen found little success in America, less than some of the experiments within Great Britain, and his utopian experiment lasted only four years before the colonists abandoned the Owenite philosophy. The community at New Harmony persisted, but they were no longer an Owenite utopian project. Owen had originally purchased the land, and a few buildings, from the previous residents at New Harmony. These previous occupants were Rappites colonists, a mostly German Protestant religious sect, which had moved to Indiana from Pennsylvania to more freely practice their beliefs and communal way of life. After establishing the first group of settlers at his community, Owen left his son William in charge at New Harmony and returned east to find more funds and colonists for his project. When Owen returned in April of 1825 he found the community of several hundred residents in chaos. He did his best to put matters in order, and succeeded fairly well, he departed again in June 1825 in search of more funds and colonists. In all, Owen spent only a few months residing at New Harmony. Within two years of its founding as an Owenite utopian experiment the New Harmony community was an economic failure, that is, it was not financially or materially self-supporting. There are a host of reasons that account for the failure of the Owenite experiment at New Harmony. The colony had trouble attracting residents, and those who did come were not always of the highest caliber. While New Harmony did bring in many ideologically committed Owenites, it also welcomed in many types of people. In a letter, Robert Dale Owen, one of Robert\\\'s sons, describes the population of New Harmony as, "a heterogeneous collection of radicals, enthusiastic devotees to principle, honest latitudinarians, and lazy theorists, with a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in". [3] In another letter, William Owen, another of Robert\\\'s sons, says that besides committed Owenites, New Harmony had attracted, "crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town makes success unlikely". [4] There was a laundry list of complaints about why the New Harmony project failed; not enough skilled craftsmen; not enough unskilled laborers; insufficient and inexperienced management and supervision; not enough housing; not enough land; not enough privacy; too much freedom; not enough freedom. Robert Owen was often away from the colony and, like him, many colonists only stayed a few months. This high turnover, as well as the problems listed above, seemed to doom this project from the outset. Between the motley collection of colonists, the factional infighting, and the lack of economic viability, the New Harmony settlement ended as a failure for Owen. The lack of economic success and factional squabbles over questions of theoretical principles and practical organization led to a large schism at New Harmony in 1826. A group carried on the Owenite project for another couple years, but finally gave up the ghost in 1829. In 1827, Owen severed ties with the community he founded, transferring ownership to his sons. After 1829 the town abandoned Owenism, and converted their community to a traditional capitalist private property system. While the town was a failure as a utopian experiment, it did produce some very interesting and significant results and persons. Under Owenite leadership New Harmony could boast of the first free public library, and the first free public school. It also became a leading center of scientific discovery in the natural science, in particular in geology where Owen\\\'s third son David Dale achieved prominence. Robert Dale, the oldest son of Robert Owen, in addition to publishing many books and pamphlets, served in both the Indiana state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. He advocated for women\\\'s rights, for free public education, and opposed slavery. It was in fact Robert Dale Owen who introduced the bill which founded the now world famous Smithsonian Institution. Fourierism Like the Owenites, the practical activity of the Fourierist movement in America was directed towards the founding of utopian communities. In the minds of the Fourierists these communities, or rather the network of these communities, would form the basis of the new society, and the transformative effects would radiate out from these communities. Though the Fourierists did much to expound and promulgate their theories in writing, their main energy was directed at founding and linking Fourierist phalanxes. A working example of their vision of a utopian way of life would, in their estimation, be the best piece of propaganda they could have. An operational model Phalanx was more likely to attract actual converts than hundreds of pounds of printed literature. One quite decisive advantage of the Fourierists was that they, unlike Owen, were not intensely skeptical. Indeed, the embrace of religious arguments, appeals to religious morality, and the use of religious modes of presenting Fourierist ideas very much helped Fourierism gain a large following in America. The Fourierist movement was more successful than the Owenite movement in America, and thus it was larger and more diverse. It was however, more distant in its ideology and practice from its founder than the Owenite movement was from Owen. The experience of the movement is not so directly tied to any one individual community. This movement was, like Owenism, short-lived, despite many Fourierists being intensely passionate. Albert Brisbane, an American traveling in Europe, became a votary of Charles Fourier and his utopian socialist philosophy. In the early 1830s Brisbane returned to America and eagerly set to work proselytizing for Fourier\\\'s ideas; edited and parsed by Brisbane for American audiences. By 1840 he was publishing The Phalanx , a Fourierist journal, but his big break came in 1842 when Horace Greeley allowed Brisbane to purchase a front-page column in his popular newspaper The New York Tribune . This platform allowed Brisbane to bring Fourier\\\'s ideas to the huge audience of the Tribune \\\'s readership. Running for about a year and a half, and reprinted in dozens of other newspapers, Brisbane\\\'s column, helped ignite the spark of the American Fourierist movement. We should note that Brisbane was not alone in working to advance Fourier\\\'s ideas in America, nor was his journal the only Fourierist publication, though it was among the earliest. Over the next decade, Fourierist phalanxes sprung up across the country, perhaps the most famous of which was the Brook Farm community in Massachusetts. The organized Fourierist movement established at least thirty phalanxes, and at it height, the movement consisted of perhaps as many as fifty Fourierist communities. One must be cognizant that there were several strains of Fourierism in America, and so deciding which communities count as Fourierist can sometimes be a matter of debate. The "phalanx" was the name Fourier gave to his ideal utopian communities. They were largely agricultural, but did not reject machinery. They were designed to self-sustaining communities in which all participants would have a chance to prosper. Fourier\\\'s phalanxes were not communist, since they were supposed to contain inequalities, that is, individuals were to be rewarded both for their effort as well as their contribution of capital. By the mid-1850s however, all but a hardy few phalanxes remained. What few did survive the collapse of the movement, were wiped out by the Civil war. Most Fourierist phalanxes lasted, on average, only a couple years; indeed, critics labeled Fourierists, \\\'four-year-ites\\\'. The longest lasting community was the North American Phalanx of Colts Neck, New Jersey, which was in continuous operation for twelve years. There is one very important way that the experience of the Brook Farm community was characteristic of the larger Fourierist movement. The Brook Farm community was originally established as a utopian community by Transcendentalist-inspired reformers. In the spring of 1841 George Ripley, and a small coterie of fellows, decamped to Brook Farm and established an experimental utopian community. Their aims were to counter the effects of a depersonalized and unequal society by removing themselves from that society, and forming a more ideal communal way of life. The Brook Farmers rejected Emerson\\\'s more individualistic, more isolationist, vision of Transcendentalist "self-culture". After four years of disorganization, factional quibbles, and lack of a cohesive vision, inhibiting the communities\\\' prosperity, the Brook Farmers decided to adopt Fourierism in1844 because it offered a more concrete plan and structure. This is what attracted many, beyond Transcendentalists, to Fourier\\\'s system, and to Fourierist phalanxes, in this era. It was a detailed plan of action for forming communities in an age when so many utopian schemes were vague and ill-defined. The Fourierist movement, brief as its life may have been, as well as the legacy of its example, made important contributions to later American political movements. Several important legacies of the Fourierist movement stand out. First, in the 1840s the Fourierists were among the earliest and strongest critics of the nascent industrial capitalist order. The Fourierists criticized capitalism as an anti-democratic system of "industrial feudalism" which subordinated workers to employers. Fourierism, and indeed the whole communitarian movement, achieved its prominence at a kind of tipping point in American history, and its failure to stop the advance of the burgeoning industrial capitalism set American society on different path than had this movement had more success. On a longer view, the legacy of the Fourierist movement continued to be seen in the communitarian aspects of the American socialist movement, as well as in the American labor movement, especially in its advocacy of producers\\\' and consumers\\\' cooperatives. The Fourierist movement has an additional interesting legacy in the way that it influenced the thinking of Edward Bellamy. Indeed, several important elements of Fourierist philosophy appear in Bellamy\\\'s utopia. Conclusion The utopian alternative was very much alive in 19th-century America. The threat various utopian movements constituted can be seen in the sheer numbers of people who flocked to religious or secular utopian communities all over the country. From the 1820s through the 1850s thousands and thousands of Americans experimented with utopianism, joining one or another experimental community. Over these decades nearly one hundred different utopian communities and projects were launched in America. Some lasted just a few months, others only a few years. Others, however, enjoyed some longevity. In general, the utopian communities that tended to last longer were the religiously inspired ones, which also very often had the advantage of being ethno-religious groupings. Many utopian groups like the Rappites or Harmonists, the Amish, and the Hutterites, were largely German Protestant sects. Though there were religious groups, e.g. the Shakers, who were successful at converting many different kinds of people to their way of life. Other utopian groups attempted to create new religions, e.g. the Mormons, and the Oneida community. In a fairly common pattern, people turned to utopian communities when economic hardship became most acute, and then left when conditions improved. The very existence of alternative, non-for-profit, ways of living posed a threat to the nascent capitalist order in America. It was only in the decades after the Civil war that most kinds of utopian communities became economically unviable as corporate consolidation, mechanization of production, and economies of scale replaced durable hand-made goods with cheaper but less durable factory-made goods. Utopian communities, as small-scale industrial producers of craft goods could simply not compete. Though many of these communities continued to be self-sufficient and survived as communities, their prosperity at first slowly, and then rather quickly, diminished, making attracting new followers and maintaining their communities difficult. What the experience of utopian communities, both religious and secular, testifies to is the ability of possibility to capture the imagination, and to inspire action. Their many different aims and principles notwithstanding, these utopian movements all sought to transform the lives of human beings through radically transforming social relations. Beyond utopian experiments in communal living, utopian thinking provided some inspiration for more practical movements like the early women\\\'s suffrage movement, the abolitionist movement, and the prohibitionist movement. The Occupy movement, brief but spectacular, is part of this utopian tradition in American history. Its memory is worth preserving, its anniversaries worth noting, because of the utopian aspect of its existence. Even for a brief time, just as with our 19th century forebears, a utopian political movement allowed a great many people the freedom to participate in the dream that a better world is possible, to experience the thrill of feeling that such a possible better world could be realized.

When taking that experience as exemplary, political estimations of utopia tend to oscillate between two extremes. Many worry that utopian thinking can swamp politics when it provides a radical social blueprint and inspires adherents to implement it mechanically (Kateb Reference Kateb 1972 ). On the other hand, utopian thinking that fails to resemble a radical blueprint is dismissed as toothless, either because it cannot be applied to practical politics or because it all too closely resembles politics as it already is (Shklar Reference Shklar and Hoffmann 1998 ). Consequently, utopia is understood to have either too much or too little political force and so new replacement utopias—especially “The Last Utopia” of human rights—are invariably found wanting (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 ). Perhaps as a result, the past decade has seen the striking rise of a realism that scorns utopian blueprints alongside attempts to decouple Marxism from the end of the Soviet Union in order to recuperate “The Idea of Communism” (Dsouzinas and Zizek Reference Dsouzinas and Zizek 2010 ). In this article, I argue that a profound misunderstanding of how political theory can relate to political practice lies behind this prolonged crisis of utopianism. Contemporary political realism offers an important critique of utopian thinking that shows why attempts to apply it appear too strong or weak; however, rather than dismissing or marginalizing utopianism, as the realists themselves do, I show how their critique can illuminate its genuine utility. When one abandons the expectation that the political force of utopias must manifest itself through attempts at application and instead considers how they can orient political actors to existing institutions, one can see utopian thinking making effective interventions by disrupting entrenched forms of legitimation, fostering new forms of identity, and revealing new potentials within existing institutional forms. These are important political and theoretical possibilities and we have good reason to value their liberatory potential on realist grounds. Utopias take many forms, but for purposes of this argument, I will use utopian thinking to refer to depictions of or reflections on highly desirable and hoped-for social and political circumstances that include no necessary reference to the means, costs, or feasibility of achieving them from our present condition. Utopian thinking does not need to imagine a perfect society—historically, it rarely does (Sargent Reference Sargent 2010 , 104)—but can, for example, envision worlds in which some contemporary problems are simply absent without proposing a plan for bringing that about. The charge that utopian thinking fails to engage appropriately with the practice of actual politics is a very old complaint—it is aimed at Socrates throughout Plato\'s Republic —but works by Raymond Geuss and Bernard Williams published over the past decade have given it new life by suggesting that the need for realism is especially timely in light of the contemporary search for new replacement utopias. Footnote 1 It is a measure of the influence of this critique that many old thinkers are now returning to prominence under the realist banner, their ideas freshly re-certified as practical and nonutopian (Ciccariello-Maher Reference Ciccariello-Maher 2014 ; Mantena Reference Mantena 2012 ). Political realists have unsurprisingly raised a variety of concerns about utopias, but the complaint that I consider here is that utopian thinking fails to orient us to our actual circumstances and problems. As I will use the term, an orientation to politics concerns how we get our bearings in our social world by identifying those features we habitually regard as the most salient parts of the landscape and which we are consequently disposed to weigh in our considered judgment about what to do. Footnote 2 Geuss and Williams argue that utopian thinking is constitutively unable to orient people properly to politics because of its theoretical methodology, which determines what is desirable or valuable without any reference to the particular political choices faced by really existing actors. For example, theorizing a world in which human rights are universally respected doesn\'t seem to make it easier to cope with a world in which the content of human rights is the subject of deep disagreement and in which the selective enforcement of human rights is used to advance national interests. Against thinking that is fundamentally unworldly and encouraging of illusions, Geuss and Williams suggest that we should be attuned above all to how people actually are and how politics really works so that we can be better oriented and take more effective political action. To the extent that they accord utopian thinking any beneficial practical role, it is as a source of motivation for engaging in politics, but never guiding how to do so. Geuss and Williams have importantly different views in many respects, including about politics, but their work is united in polemically suggesting that the most important distinction in contemporary political thought and practice is between realists and others. In the profusion of secondary literature responding to Geuss and Williams and carrying their work forward, surprisingly few have asked, how should their realism be evaluated on its own terms—that is, not only as a theoretical view but also as a political intervention ? I will argue that the resultant orientation to politics is unnecessarily limited. Importantly, my argument differs from defenses of utopian thinking which take impractical political thought as a worthwhile end in itself (e.g., Estlund Reference Estlund 2011 ). Using human rights as a case study, I show how realist critiques have obscured the emancipatory potential of regarding them as a utopian project. Political projects advancing human rights are not necessarily utopian, but imagining a world in which “the dignity of each individual will enjoy secure international protection” through the realization of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is surely what historian and human rights critic Samuel Moyn calls “a recognizably utopian program” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 1). Against the assumption—shared by Geuss, Williams, and Moyn alike—that the adherents of such utopian visions understand them as blueprints to be applied in practice, I argue that envisioning an ideal society need not be a precursor to attempts to build it. Rather, as I show by analyzing the uses of human rights by Malcolm X and Michel Foucault, utopian thinking can orient us to existing political institutions in ways that both track the operations of power and attend to real opportunities for resistance. Through a counterintuitive reading of John Rawls\'s account of orientation, I argue that even an impossible-to-realize ideal theory can help us understand important features of our present circumstances. In short, a realism that seeks to facilitate effective political action should recognize its own interdependence with utopian thinking. Realism usefully highlights the cost of every political choice, but often overlooks the costs associated with adopting realism itself; an insistence on seeing things as they are can easily curdle into an insistence that things are as they must be, especially because new political possibilities are both risky and difficult to perceive. It is here that utopias retain their political force. No longer understood simply as blueprints for action or principles to be applied mechanically, utopias can give us a novel perspective on our own politics valuable on realist grounds. THE POLITICS OF PRIORITIZING IDEAL THEORY The project of defending utopian thinking on realist grounds may seem quixotic in light of what many take to be their obvious opposition. For example, William Galston begins his explanation of political realism with what he calls “the least surprising point—namely, realism\'s resolutely antiutopian stance” (Galston Reference Galston 2010 , 394; see also Jubb Reference Jubb 2015 , 920). However, others perceive a more complicated relation; Enzo Rossi and Matt Sleat contend that “conceptually, nothing precludes realists from resurrecting the 1968 slogan ‘Be realistic. Demand the impossible’” (Rossi and Sleat Reference Rossi and Sleat 2014 , 690), even if few have actually done so in practice. Consequently, it is important to be specific about the particular realist objection to utopian thinking that I want to consider. In contrast to the tradition of thinking about politics that sees theorizing as pursuing truths that are essentially separate from political action, a realist approach focuses on how theories are lived now, as they shape ways of seeing the existing political world by drawing our attention to particular features of it. That habitual attention naturally leads political agents to act in particular ways, as some actions appear appropriate to the perceived environment while others become almost unthinkable. As Geuss puts it, “My interest is in the practical coherence of a certain general framework for orienting political action in the contemporary world” (Geuss Reference Geuss 2001 , vii; hereafter, “HIP”). One of the strengths of this view is that a framework for orientation can draw from many different resources, including not only political theory but also other practices, like human rights, that shape our expectations of politics. Thus, for realists, the key question of political theory is not “what would an ideal society look like?” Rather, they ask, “what kind of political thinking will orient people most coherently and effectively to intervene in politics?” For Geuss, the answer is clear: . . .political philosophy must be realist. That means, roughly speaking, that it must start from and be concerned in the first instance not with how people ought ideally (or ought ‘rationally’) to act, what they ought to desire, or value, the kind of people they ought to be, etc., but, rather, with the way the social, economic, political, etc., institutions actually operate in some society at some given time, and what really does move human beings to act in given circumstances. ( Reference Geuss 2008 , 9; hereafter, “PRP”) Rather than putting ideals first, Geuss wants to put the facts first (bracketing for now the question of where exactly ideals go). Political actors that fail to do this—whether they draw those ideals from political theory or the UDHR—will almost certainly not promote their intended ends since they will habitually overlook the most important features of their circumstances. In this section, I consider Geuss\'s account of utopian thinking in political theory as a source of disorientation before turning to the role of utopian thinking in the political project of human rights next. Geuss offered a particularly vivid symbol of his critique with the holiday card that he reportedly sent in 2004 juxtaposing portraits of Immanuel Kant and John Rawls with images of George W. Bush and prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib (Worsnip Reference Worsnip 2013 ). Understanding how and why Geuss connects these philosophers to actions that they would plainly deplore will clarify the nature and limits of his analysis of utopian thinking\'s relation to orientation. Footnote 3 In order to motivate action after the horrors of Holocaust, Rawls constructs a “realistic utopia” in which justice is fully realized “someday, somewhere” (Rawls Reference Rawls 2001b , 127). But Geuss dismisses this consoling vision. Footnote 4 In 2003, he asked rhetorically about Rawls, “Are reflections about the correct distribution of goods and service in a ‘well-ordered society’ the right kind of intellectual response to slavery, torture, and mass murder?” (Geuss Reference Geuss 2005 , 31) To think about a utopia free of unjustifiable inequality is to miss the most pressing political problems that have to be faced now and, to that extent, may be complicit in their perpetuation. Who needs utopia when you can\'t even prevent a catastrophe? It may seem obvious that theorizing an ideal future would not orient its adherents to pressing contemporary problems, but Geuss\'s point is not merely that the utopian ambitions of egalitarian liberals distract them from preventing disaster, in the mode of Judith Shklar\'s “liberalism of fear” (Shklar Reference Shklar and Hoffmann 1998 ). Rather, Geuss argues that their understanding of the relationship between political thinking and political action disposes them to disorientation because of the conception of normativity they employ. Geuss refers to these alternatives to realism as “ethics-first” thinking, writing, “[t]he view I am rejecting assumes that one can complete the work of ethics first, attaining an ideal theory of how we should act, and then in a second step, one can apply that ideal theory to the action of political agents” (PRP, 8). Geuss believes that these two features necessarily go together: (i) Normative Priority : employing normative values whose relevance and importance are determined without any reference to the particular problems the thinker encounters in politics. (ii) Politics as Application : understanding political practice as the application of a theory developed independently of engagement with politics itself. On this view, the only possible use of a utopian vision whose normative desirability purports to transcend its circumstances is to serve as a blueprint for realizing that vision. While I will argue later that these two steps are in fact separable, Geuss is right that some of the most prominent contemporary forms of political theorizing conjoin both features to troubling effect. In particular, many practitioners of ideal theory do produce “realistic utopias” that they take as blueprints, conceiving of political practice as an attempt to approximate an ideal theory of just social institutions. For those who engage in ideal theory as blueprint , normative priority is given to the envisioned future and present actions are oriented around it; if a present political opportunity appears incompatible with the utopian future, then that is all one needs to know in order to reject it. As A. John Simmons writes, “We, as theorists of justice, simply should not care which policies are politically possible (etcetera) unless those policies are also on an acceptable path to a just institutional structure” ( Reference Simmons 2010 , 34). Yet despite being identified as the aim of political practice, the desirability of the ideal future is determined without any reference to the means or costs of achieving of it; Thomas Pogge articulates the methodology of many such political philosophers when he makes a sharp distinction between the project of constructing an ideal theory and the challenges of realizing that vision, writing, “I say little about transition problems: about how the ideal society can be reached from where we are now, and what demands justice imposes on the transition” ( Reference Pogge and Kosch 2007 , page x). Tragic choices among constrained options have no obvious role to play in the view. Despite this, political action today can be guided directly by a utopian future because it is there that the normative values that one should promote today are worked out. For example, in his theory of global justice, Luis Cabrera writes, “My claim is that, with a defensible set of global institutions in mind—one which plausibly would secure the rights of all persons—we can extrapolate duties that would apply in the present global system, including ones to move institutions closer to the target” ( Reference Cabrera 2010 , 67). If I want to figure out what to do within the present global system, I look first of all to an envisioned future and only then to existing institutions. For ideal theory as blueprint, existing politics appears primarily as imposing obstacles to achieving an ideal rather than as a realm with its own dynamics to be respected. Existing political institutions are accordingly either overlooked entirely or understood as having an a priori relation to the values that the view promotes. Such theories thereby offer idealized pictures of institutions where their flaws appear as correctable deviations from a conceptual model; in contrast, a realist analysis begins by observing the operations of power and thus bases its interpretation of existing institutions on their actual functioning. A key example here is the state. Consider Kant\'s conception of rights and justice, which Geuss provocatively links with Abu Ghraib. In his political writings, Kant argues that the rational state makes justice possible by making rights stable and enforceable in the world. Kant further argues that, because having a state enforce one\'s rights is a practical precondition to being able to enjoy those rights, the state\'s action through the rule of law cannot be an infringement on my rights and freedom so long as it is enforced equally and in good faith. Footnote 5 On this interpretation, Kant uses an a priori argument to establish the universal rationality of the state, an actually existing institution in the world. This has significant effects on any resultant orientation to politics, making the state appear as a fixed point rather than a historically contingent development. We seem to already know in advance a state\'s most important features without having to inspect it. Geuss is rightly concerned about the effects of this since it tends to obscure the actual workings of power and to misunderstand the choices in front of us. This also has the status-quo-preserving effect of making it easy to justify states’ existence and (often dubious) actions. So, while it may be hyperbolic to link Kant with the abuses of Abu Ghraib, it is plausible for Geuss to argue that Kant\'s view orients him to politics in a way that presumptively legitimizes state violence and directs attention away from the costs of creating and maintaining order. Any utopian thinking that reduces politics to a venue for the unmediated application of a priori normative values risks doing the same. Geuss\'s critique illuminates why utopian thinking today appears too strong and too weak when we consider implementing it. On one hand, utopian thinking is too ambitious in describing an ideal without any attention to the means to realize it; to attend in the first instance to the features of an ideal future disposes the visionary to acts ill-suited to his surroundings. On the other hand, utopian thinking is not ambitious enough because the ideals described too closely resemble the world as it already is (Geuss Reference Geuss 2010a , 429). While the values and ideals they hold up are meant to have been developed without any necessary reference to our contingent circumstances, “[u]topian thinking assumes that we have too much cognitive ability to detach ourselves from the world we actually live in, to ‘jump over our own shadow’ as Hegel put it” and, as a result, “[turns] out to have the same basic defects of the present, merely magnified” (Geuss Reference Geuss, Stoecker and Iorio 2015 , 155). The visions of just societies produced by contemporary egalitarian liberals have the same methodological problems as Kant\'s conception of the state; attempting to develop ideal theories of just institutions without first understanding the way real institutions operate produces utopias that, at best, do nothing to address real defects and, at worst, mistake existing flaws for fixed points of the social world. Utopian thinking thus fails to provide an appropriate orientation to politics twice over—first, because it misidentifies the most salient features of a situation; second, because it leads the utopian thinker to misunderstand the character of his own agency and ideals. UTOPIAN THINKING IN POLITICAL PRACTICE For Geuss, ideal theory as blueprint represents the problem with utopian thinking in political theory, but it is human rights that exemplifies the pitfalls of utopian thinking in political practice. Though most human rights advocates do not have fully articulated philosophical methods and see themselves as responding directly to urgent crises, Geuss argues that they nevertheless advance ethics-first views. Advocates misunderstand how rights function in the world because, in order to make rights inviolable and urgent, they have given those rights a normative status that cannot be affected by empirical developments. Footnote 6 On Geuss\'s view, the very idea of right requires that ethics “come first”; rights are meant to be respected in every circumstance, rendering the specifics of the situation of secondary importance. The practical failure to respect a human right does not undermine the normativity of the right; on the contrary, it only makes it more important to claim the right, often with perverse effects. Geuss highlights three specific ways that the ethics-first orientation provided by a human rights framework ignores important features of politics and thereby facilitates ineffective action. First, the utopian vision of a world where everyone\'s human rights are protected is premised on denying the fact that political action always has a cost. How would conflicts among the rights enumerated there be resolved? Can such a world be achieved without violating human rights along the way? Do we have enough resources for everyone to enjoy the right to “periodic holidays with pay” asserted in Article 24 of UDHR? Geuss argues that there are no good answers to these questions because human rights are an “inconvenient fiction” that relies on “a fantastically optimistic view about God, the world, natural resources, and the avoidability of conflict” (HIP, 149). Geuss sees those who reject realism as wanting to have it all and asserts instead that “[p]olitics as we know it is a matter of differential choice: opting for A rather than B” and doing so at an advantageous time (PRP, 30, emphasis original). Lacking an orientation to the dichotomous nature of political choices, advocates are disposed to intervene in politics in ways dictated by their normative ideal rather than by evaluating the costs of competing options. In the face of a brutal dictator abroad, advocates are likely to say, “We have to do something!” because they assume that there must be something we can do when rights are violated. As a result of their utopian ideal, they are oriented to the situation in a way that leads them away from considering the possibility that the costs of “doing something” may be higher than the costs of doing nothing. Second, Geuss thinks that the ethics-first nature of an orientation to human rights ensures that advocates overlook power and have an incoherent relation to institutions and enforcement. Since the UDHR has no institution charged with its implementation, Geuss dismisses human rights as “no more than a moralizing conception about what would be desirable without any concrete specification of an enforcing agency” (HIP, 142). Instead, enforcement is left to states, which is foolish at best when we know that states overrule human rights all the time when it is convenient for their purposes (HIP, 148). Insisting that human rights be protected by states only gives them a further tool to legitimate their violence and, since states are the primary violators as well as the primary protectors of rights, Geuss thinks that this problem is insoluble. The disjuncture between how rights operate in our world, where powerful actors use them to advance their ends, and how they would operate in a utopia, where everyone\'s rights would be protected by impartial global mechanisms, is symptomatic of the way ethics-first orientations dispose people to overlook the centrality of power in politics. Third, human rights doctrine orients its adherents to mistake their own character as political agents. In a recent interview, Geuss said, “To give priority to claiming rights gives us the completely wrong attitude toward ourselves, other political agencies and the state because it basically prioritizes us as passive clients of the nanny-state” ( Reference Geuss 2013 , 93). Human rights orient us to politics in a way that emphasizes the agency of states and the passivity of individuals without any tools for thinking about other forms of political organization or action since they lack a priori normative status. By taking individuals as the primary object of concern, the human rights framework relies on a “tacit (and utterly implausible form of) atomistic individualism” ( Reference Geuss 2013 , 93) that leads to ineffective political mobilization and facilitates state control. Demanding human rights entails understanding injustice as primarily a wrong done to individuals, which disposes people to respond as solitary victims. In short, like egalitarian liberal ideal theories, the human rights utopia articulated by the UDHR and its proponents describes a desirable world without any reference to the means for its achievement while its hodgepodge of goals seem to aim simultaneously too high and too low. A right to holidays with pay may seem not merely unrealistic but irrelevant in a world where a billion people live on a dollar a day. At the same time, even global protection of the rights in the UDHR would fall short of a genuine utopia. Observing that the rise of the human rights movement in recent decades has accompanied the growth of economic inequality, Samuel Moyn notes in a Geussian spirit, “even were all the dreams of international human rights movements to be fulfilled, it is as much low ambitions as failures to realize them that made human rights companions of market fundamentalism” ( Reference Moyn, Lettinga and van Troost 2015 , 15). In light of such problems, Geuss argues that, for anyone properly oriented to contemporary politics, the “last utopia” of human rights would not appear worth pursuing. So, does Geuss believe that the point of political theory is simply to describe what politics is, counsel acceptance of it, and encourage quiescence? It can sound like this, as when Geuss calls his view “basically Hobbesian” (PRP, 22). But this is too simple. His realism chastens our normative ambitions by warning us away from utopian aspirations that take stability for granted or rest on an impossible agreement about values. As a consequence of this turn to the possible, his realism also chastens our methodological ambitions by exhorting us to remain close to the actual effects of power in our analysis, since such knowledge will be more useful for addressing the political choices we face. But Geuss imagines these Hobbesian requirements on theorizing to have liberatory potential: “Suppose now we decided to abandon the narrow limitations imposed on us by traditional ideas of what a ‘philosophical ethics’ could (and must) be. Then one could imagine ways of orienting ourselves in the world which went beyond the sorts of things envisaged and discussed in traditional forms of ethics” ( Reference Geuss 2014 , 192). Geuss sees realism not as an irksome constraint on the kinds of political theories we should offer, but as making possible a better kind of thinking and acting; one who adopts realism has simply been freed from illusory and impossible desires. We may not be able to achieve utopia, but perhaps, once we have left it behind, we will be able to see new possibilities that are good in their own ways. REALISM AS A GUIDE TO ACTION? Geuss makes a persuasive case that, in some important instances, utopian thinking orients its adherents to politics in a way that leads to incoherent, ineffective action. But Geuss\'s critique also raises difficult issues for his own alternative approach. Recall that he identifies ethics-first thinking as having two steps, first identifying a normative value and then applying it without attending to some essential features of politics. Because he sees the second step necessarily following from the first, Geuss suggests that the root of the problem with how ethics-first thinking guides political action is its conception of normative values. But does realism offer an alternative means of judging what to do? Realists who accept Geuss\'s critique have essentially three paths to choose from: (1) realism could simply serve as a corrective for other views; (2) realism could guide action without providing normative evaluations; or (3) realism could provide its own conception of normative evaluation. If political realism is content to be merely a corrective, then it can let the other views supply the normative values and suggest either that the means to pursue those ends are unrealistic or that the values cannot be fully realized. On this reading, human rights doctrine is inconvenient by its own lights; realism does not offer a substantive or methodological alternative so much as it acts as a permanent gadfly, assessing the coherence of other positions without offering any distinctive values of its own. A realism of this kind is an ethos or what Mark Philp calls “more like a code of honor. . .[than] a set of metatheoretical claims” ( Reference Philp 2012 , 637). A realism that refuses to be action-guiding could still be prescriptive in the sense that it counsels a clear-eyed confrontation with reality without having anything to say about what happens after that confrontation. This ethos typically narrates its bearer as a kind of tragic hero, one both freed by knowing the truth but also cursed to bear the opprobrium of those whose illusions he shatters. In these moods, Geuss also identifies his position with Theodor Adorno\'s; some circumstances require taking up a “merely negative” attitude without providing any reason to think shattered illusions can be replaced ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 9). Yet Geuss often makes stronger claims for realism and suggests that it can facilitate better, more effective political action on its own. In places, he even suggests that realism should lead directly to some quite particular courses of action, such as “[fostering] further European integration” ( Reference Geuss 2010a , 28). But how does one judge possible political actions without appealing to some values that they would promote? Sometimes Geuss suggests that once one adopts his perspective, its virtues will become evident (PRP, 17). That would be a doubly optimistic kind of realism, since it implies both an epistemic optimism that we have a reasonably reliable access to reality and a practical optimism that changing the way we talk about that reality will make things go better (Honig and Stears Reference Honig, Stears, Floyd and Stears 2011 ). Such optimism runs counter to Geuss\'s own insistence on the persistence of disagreement. Even those who adopt a realist orientation to politics will surely offer competing interpretations of events, discern different possibilities for action, and seek to promote diverse ends. Geuss erases this pluralism when he conflates orientation and normative evaluation. While adopting political realism may suffice to rule out certain actions as self-defeating, it is rarely enough to defend the affirmative choice of a particular action. If Geuss wants to offer a free-standing approach to political thinking (and it is not always clear that he does), then such a realism needs to be able to make explicit the value of the actions that it promotes. Consider the pressing political question of how the EU and its citizens should relate to a country abusing human rights. Geuss asserts that the EU should embrace China “in the interest of collaboration on the long-term goal of demilitarizing international politics” ( Reference Geuss 2010a , 29). This is surely a worthy goal, but if political action should promote this aim, how does realism really differ from utopian thinking? Geuss acknowledges that “[i]t is a value judgment of a kind to think that a world in which the use of extreme military force is routine is, other things being equal, less good than one in which the use of force is uncommon” ( Reference Geuss 2010a , 30). Geuss seeks to make his judgment more limited than the human rights advocate\'s by introducing a comparative element; he does not suggest, for example, that making military force uncommon is the sole end of politics and that all actions failing to promote this end are thereby impermissible. But the insufficiency of Geuss\'s conception of normative values is made clear by the phrase “other things being equal.” If the EU were to abandon its alliance with the US to become closer to China, other things would not remain equal. In deciding to do so, the EU would surely need to make a judgment about how to weigh the other values at stake; concerns for the environment, prosperity, free speech, and stability may all pull in different directions. But because Geuss\'s criticism of utopian thinking assumes that prioritizing particular normative values leads directly to an orientation to politics as an application of those values, he minimizes his own reliance on normative values and does not address how to weigh them. Rejecting an implausibly univocal realism thus puts Geuss in a bind: if he is to be entitled to the substantive political claims he wants to make (no to human rights, yes to an EU-China alliance), Geuss must reject his own methodological criticism of utopian thinking. Alternatively, he could rest content as a gadfly or, more dramatically, renounce the claim to facilitate better actions and say that a truly realist orientation reveals all our political actions to be equally meaningless. Geuss has oscillated among these positions, moving from an almost nihilistic despair to a measured appreciation of utopian thinking and back again. In the former vein, Geuss memorably stated that “[w]e are not, of course, now in a situation in which it is realistically possible for us to envisage any fundamental change in our world which we could ourselves bring about by our own efforts” ( Reference Geuss 2014 , 194). This politics of futility really does suggest that our actions do not much matter and, as a result, even the value of a clear-eyed confrontation with reality becomes doubtful. However, in other moods, he has written that realism is not necessarily antiutopian ( Reference Geuss Geuss 2010b) and has gone so far as to say that “unless one thinks that we already live in the best of all possible worlds and that lack of flexibility in our relation to our own future is a good thing, giving up our utopian impulses completely would represent a serious loss” ( Reference Geuss, Stoecker and Iorio 2015 , 158). Shadowed by the worry that utopian thinking will result in the reduction of politics to enacting blueprints, Geuss carefully refers to “utopian impulses,” the content of which remains elusive, rather than utopian thinking, which provides more determinate content. Footnote 7 Instead of seeing utopia as a potential aid to orientation, Geuss locates its practical political function elsewhere as when, in a discussion of Gustav Landauer, he notes that “utopian impulses are motivationally essential” ( Reference Geuss, Stoecker and Iorio 2015 , 156). But this raises the question, what will adherents of utopia be motivated to do? Without articulating an alternative practical use for them, those who rely on utopias to motivate engagement in politics will likely default to applying them as blueprints—precisely what Geuss wants to avoid. Consequently, we must look elsewhere for a realist account of the use of utopian thinking that can supplant the impulse to implement utopia. WILLIAMS AND POLITICAL NORMATIVITY If Geuss ends up opening the door for utopian thinking to play some practical role, how wide should realists open that door? Bernard Williams suggests that we need not wholly exclude from politics the normative values that make utopias desirable; rather, our orientations should simply restrict the range of normative values we attend to in politics, disposing us to attend to a similarly restricted set of political visions. Once again, human rights exemplify the problem with utopian thinking; against the “unfortunate” profusion of rights enumerated in the UDHR ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 64), Williams argues that human rights should be sharply limited if they are to function appropriately in politics. However, this argument is as self-defeating as Geuss\'s. Williams pursues the third path open to Geuss and argues that utopian thinking leads to Politics as Application not because of the employment of normative value per se , but rather because utopia colonizes politics with nonpolitical values. However, I will argue that Williams\'s view also crucially relies on such nonpolitical values. This suggests that realists should abandon the view that Politics as Application is attributable to any methodological error in ambitious claim-making about normative desirability; there is no relation between the scope of a utopian vision and people\'s propensity to treat it as a blueprint for politics. Geuss cites Bernard Williams\'s realism as influencing his own ( Reference Geuss 2005 ; Reference Geuss 2014 ), so the similarity of their approaches should be unsurprising. Williams too identifies with Hobbes and writes, “I identify the ‘first’ political question in Hobbesian terms as the securing of order, protection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation. It is ‘first’ because solving it is the condition of solving, indeed posing, any others” ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 30). While Williams calls those outside the realist camp “political moralists” rather than “ethics-first” thinkers, their characteristic error once again concerns their conception of normativity and their number prominently includes Rawls, understood as the most important reproducer of Kant\'s erroneous “application” view ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 ). Where Williams parts ways with Geuss is in offering a particular conception of desirable order that has a realist normativity conceived as internal to politics rather than imported from a morality established apart from it. Williams locates that normativity in people\'s pervasive concern with legitimacy. Williams introduces what he calls the Basic Legitimation Demand (BLD), which “can be equated with there being an ‘acceptable’ solution to the first political question” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 4). The normative value of an order comes from this genuine acceptance by those subject to it and so we should accept great variation in views of what counts as a good reason to accept order. For example, according to Williams, inequality of status was quite compatible with legitimacy in medieval Europe, but conditions of modernity are such that people insist upon some form of equality as part of the BLD. Utopian thinking that sets higher aims for politics mistakes the values appropriate to a realm defined by power and disagreement. Williams combines this acknowledgement of local variation in what counts as acceptable with the belief that there are nonetheless limits to what counts as politics at all. Williams considers a caste society with a minority group “no better off than enemies of the state” and which has no reason to see the state as anything other than sheer coercive force ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 5). Williams notes, “there is nothing to be said to this group to explain why they shouldn\'t revolt” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 5, emphasis original) and so the BLD is clearly not met. Williams adds one further caveat: “the critical theory principle” calls for making sure that the structure of domination does not manipulate people into accepting the status quo ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 14). This principle makes the normativity of Williams\'s conception of order especially clear since it gives an observer a reason to think the BLD has not been met even when some of those subject to a state think otherwise. Williams\'s account thus helps us to see how a realist account could criticize orientations beyond offering an immanent critique of utopian aspirations. A useful orientation would facilitate practically coherent actions that contribute to order of the right kind—one freely accepted and legitimate according to the standards of those subject to it. An inconvenient orientation would fail to recognize that what counts as legitimate varies from place to place and time to time. For Williams, the refusal of universal applicability makes the normativity of his view internal to politics; where attempts to apply utopian thinking see politics as merely the venue for applying a priori values, Williams\'s realism sees politics as the context from which values arise. Despite this, Williams fails at differentiating his realist view of normativity from purportedly moralizing utopian views; human rights again help illustrate the problem. Williams writes, “the nearer political thought gets to action, as in the concrete affirmation of human rights, the more likely it is to be frivolous if it is utopian” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 25) and so, against the UDHR, Williams defends a core of human rights against torture, the denial of religious expression, and other wrongs he regards as “obvious” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 62). Such rights orient us to the boundary of politics since they mark when “the supposed solution [to the first political question], political power, [becomes] part of the problem” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 63) and therefore can never be accepted as legitimate. But in addressing two situations of apparent human rights violations that concern communities with diverging conceptions of legitimacy—women\'s rights and humanitarian intervention—Williams\'s argument relies on values from outside politics. These are not marginal cases to consider and they frequently press practical dilemmas on us; an orientation that disposes us to overlook them is fatally incomplete. Williams\'s claims may be more limited than the political moralists he targets, but as with Geuss, the difference between the views concerns the scope of their extrapolitical requirements, not a difference in their kind . Footnote 8 Consider the question of whether an egalitarian society should consider it a human rights violation when another country denies women the right to drive or vote. Williams writes, “the contemporary world is certainly within reach of the past, and the influences of the past include, now, theocratic conceptions of government and patriarchal ideas of the rights of women. Should we regard practices elsewhere that still express such conceptions as violations of fundamental human rights?” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 70) and answers no. He writes, “[t]he charge that a practice violates fundamental human rights is ultimate, the most serious of political accusations. In their most basic form, violations of human rights are very obvious, and so is what is wrong with them: unmediated coercion, might rather than right” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 72). Williams claims that the oppression of women is generally not a case of unmediated coercion because both men and women in theocratic and patriarchal societies are “jointly caught up in a set of beliefs which regulate their lives and are indeed unsound, but which are shared in ways that move the society further away from the paradigm of unjust coercion” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 27). Williams worries that labeling such cases human rights violations will lead to disastrous interventions as advocates force norms of gender equity on a society that doesn\'t widely accept them. Since it would be straightforwardly illegitimate to install a new government to protect my preferred a priori standards of human rights when its subjects did not accept them, Williams believes political realism leads to a principle of noninterference in such cases. As he describes it, his view “tells [people] about certain judgments which they need not make”—that is, we can safely overlook such possibilities because there are neither philosophical nor political reasons to act on them ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 68). Footnote 9 But there are a host of ways that someone who believes that women\'s rights are human rights could act because of that belief that avoid violating the BLD. Should egalitarians advocate for government policies that sanction such theocratic governments? Should they give money and support to indigenous feminist groups that are seeking to organize discontent and resistance? A realist orientation has no reason to direct attention away from these political possibilities. Williams has two options here: either his realism is indeterminate about cases where there are competing standards of legitimacy—which would undermine its claim to being an adequate source of orientation—or he must endorse noninterference on grounds he should regard as normatively “external” to politics. Williams opts for the latter and suggests that we ought not regard patriarchal oppression of women as one the “central core of evils” to which an international response is appropriate ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 74). This value judgment about the gravity of patriarchal oppression is not entailed by Williams\'s conception of politics, but rather is derived from normative and empirical considerations external to it—including a conservative view that counsels the preservation of existing conceptions of legitimacy until combating core evils requires some change in them. In trying to carve out a set of “obvious” human rights from the broader utopian program of achieving a world that respects the UDHR, Williams converges with critics like Moyn, who writes, “preventing catastrophe through minimalist ethical norms and building utopia through maximalist political vision. . .are absolutely different” and suggests that advocates “should restrict themselves to offering minimal constraints on responsible politics, not a new form of maximal politics of their own” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 226–7). But there is a cost to this effort to divorce human rights from utopianism: interpreting human rights as minimal constraints on politics implies that violations of those constraints are a form of domination located outside politics. Williams notes, “one lot of people terrorizing another lot of people is not a political situation” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 63); as a result, even when the atrocities are perpetrated by governments on minority groups, he characterizes the resultant suffering as a kind of moral wrong. As Williams himself notes, this way of characterizing the situation opens the door to justifications of humanitarian intervention as “an enlightened imperialism” since it identifies the minority group as suffering victims rather than political agents ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 151). In sum, to rule out both noncoercive efforts to shift standards of legitimacy (as in his judgment that the oppression of women should not understood as a human rights violation) and coercion in the name of nonpolitical suffering (if he wishes to block imperialism), Williams needs some additional normative premise to support noninterference. But any such premise would not be internal to politics as he has construed it. This problem is telling. In seeking to avoid the application of utopian visions to those that do not share them, these realists have consistently misunderstood the nature of their own position and its relation to utopian thinking—that is, they\'ve mistaken the politics of their own intervention. At bottom, their differences with opponents are not philosophical disagreements about the nature of value; in defending their preferred policies, both Geuss and Williams make use of the kind of values they claim to reject. Rather, their crucial difference from their opponents is a practical disagreement about what we can do to address contemporary political problems. Their constrained sense of how ideals can be used in politics prevents them from recognizing the realist grounds for valuing utopian thinking and, as a result, their realism needlessly cuts off consideration of some genuine political possibilities, inadvertently supporting the status quo despite their professedly liberatory intent. To see this, the next section considers alternative uses of human rights that show how utopian claims can avoid Politics as Application. REALIST HUMAN RIGHTS? A political theory cannot implement itself and the way a theory is applied may have effects contrary to what the theory establishes as ideal, as when human rights are used to legitimize state violence. Geuss and Williams are right that many practitioners of utopian thinking fail to account for this. But they are wrong to assume that application or motivation are the only practical uses of utopias; exploring the ways that some utopian uses of human rights can orient their adherents to present political possibilities can resolve the impasse that realists face when they claim to distinguish themselves based on a distinctive approach to normativity. None of this undercuts the realist argument that human rights claims can legitimize dangerous exercises of state power at home and abroad, in part because they are seen as outside politics—but it is essential to note that this perception is carefully cultivated by some advocates rather than intrinsic to the concept. As Moyn notes, “if those who invented the contemporary human rights culture were utopians, they were Machiavellians too, devising a strategy that would allow their brand of transformation to differ from the world as it was but also from alternative political agendas—often by strategically denying that their aims were strategic at all” ( Reference Moyn and Etinson 2014 , 25). Major human rights NGOs continue to strike this strategically apolitical pose despite the fact that it leads them to close alliances with human rights violators like the U.S. government. Footnote 10 The realists are right to point out that utopian thinking that positions itself as above politics can serve oppressive ends. Yet, as Williams\'s approach to humanitarian intervention showed, realists actually exacerbate that danger by locating rights violations outside politics. A better response on realist grounds is to emphasize the political status of human rights claims so that they can be seen as contestable articulations of particular demands. Indeed, many advocates make use of human rights in precisely this way; instead of expressing a longing to transcend politics, human rights claims are often better understood as political claims against prevailing views of legitimacy and the orientations that support them. To illustrate this possibility, I turn to two perhaps unlikely utopians: Michel Foucault and Malcolm X. Where the ideal theorist imagines a world in which everyone fully complies with the requirements of justice (Simmons Reference Simmons 2010 , 3–5), these thinkers of what might be called oppositional utopias envision desirable but impracticable responses to existing injustices; in particular, by using human rights to imagine an impossible unity of the powerless that momentarily erases their internal political differences, they produce an orientation to politics that perceives important possibilities that would otherwise be overlooked. It is important not to exaggerate the differences between ideal and oppositional utopias, however, since one can also engage in ideal theorizing that is appropriately oriented to real problems, as I argue in the next section. My point here is to show that avowedly utopian uses of human rights can contribute to an effective orientation to politics and so realists need not restrict them to a minimum core of claims or dismiss them entirely. While it may surprise to turn to him here, Foucault argued explicitly that utopias can draw our attention to political possibilities in our own world, avowing his interest in the “actually realized utopias in which. . .all the other real emplacements that can be found within the culture are, at the same time, represented, contested, and reversed” ( Reference Foucault and Faubion 1998 , 178). The kinds of utopias that interest Foucault are those that exist in some form within our world, but which also point beyond and contradict it. Two primary forms of utopia recur throughout his work: first, “the profoundly and originally utopian experience of the body” (Foucault Reference Foucault, Jones and Allais 2006 , 233); second, revolts and uprisings—what he describes as “the possibility of this moment where life cannot be exchanged, where power becomes powerless, and where, in front of the gallows and the machine guns, men rise up” (Afary and Anderson Reference Afary and Anderson 2005 , 264). I focus on the latter—ways of imagining the surprising reversal of power relations through collective action. We can see what makes this utopian in Foucault\'s sense by turning briefly to his reporting on the Iranian revolution. Asking Iranians what they wanted in 1978, Foucault reports their replies: “‘A utopia,’ some told me without any pejorative implication. ‘An ideal,’ most of them said to me. At any rate, it is something very old and also very far into the future” (Afary and Anderson Reference Afary and Anderson 2005 , 206). For Foucault, revolt is utopian because uprisings have always happened but also point beyond themselves to a world in which the collective sense of possibility and unity of that moment impossibly continues beyond the revolt itself. Of course, such utopian visions can themselves become oppressive when taken up by the powerful, as the actual Iranian revolution vividly illustrated, but to imagine otherwise would be to endorse precisely a blueprint for ending politics entirely. Such “unmasking” of utopia or human rights as dangerously enmeshed in power relations could never serve to discredit them entirely to Foucault, though, since he believes that no discourse takes place outside of power relations (Patton Reference Patton 2004 ). Nevertheless, this acknowledgement of the dangerous power of utopian thinking can help us to understand what Ben Golder aptly calls Foucault\'s “critical affirmation of rights discourse” (Golder Reference Golder 2011 , 286). Foucault sees human rights as utopian precisely because they are embedded in our politics, but also point beyond it and can contest it; indeed, he even sees a human rights framework as helping us to orient us to the possibility of a global revolt. Consider his 1981 remarks at a press conference to promote an effort to defend Vietnamese boat people (available in Keenan Reference Keenan 1987 , 20–1). Speaking on behalf of “a certain shared difficulty in accepting what is happening,” Foucault asserts the existence of “an international citizenry, which has its rights, which has its duties, and which promises to raise itself up against every abuse of power, no matter who the author or the victim.” Foucault here uses rights talk to an eminently political end without making any claims to a prepolitical or a priori foundation and without legitimizing state action. On the contrary, the rights of this international citizenry come precisely from a clear-eyed assessment of real political institutions, as he avows when he says, “People\'s misfortune must never be a silent remainder of politics. It founds an absolute right to rise up and to address those who hold power.” Unlike Williams\'s account of suffering as a moral wrong, Foucault avoids the trap of making those whose rights have been violated into victims in need of an enlightened imperial rescue. Instead, Foucault makes it clear that his own speech is political and interested, saying “After all, we are all governed and, to that extent, in solidarity.” Foucault\'s comments illustrate the potential for realist paths that Geuss and Williams miss. To speak of an international citizenry that takes direct action “against every abuse of power, no matter who the author or the victim” is a characteristic utopian hope insofar as it is both desirable and impracticable that everyone do what they ought to. But Foucault is not best understood as setting out a plan based on a priori principles or suggesting that we try to implement this utopian vision while ignoring possible political actions that are not on the path to its realization. Nor does Foucault\'s invocation of human rights constitute a repudiation of his earlier radical insights about power or a neoliberal turn that settles for the adequacy of traditional rights as a defense against domination, as some have argued (Paras Reference Paras 2006 ). Rather, Foucault asserts the rights of international citizenry as a response to the failure of institutions that ground their own legitimacy in a monopoly on rights protection. As Foucault explained in lectures given at the Collège de France in January 1976, his analysis typically aims “to understand power in its most regional forms and institutions, and especially at the points where this power transgresses the rules of right that organize and delineate it, oversteps those rules and is invested in institutions, is embodied in techniques and acquires the material means to intervene, sometimes in violent ways” ( Reference Foucault and Macey 2003 , 27–8). Geuss notably describes his own analysis of the way that rights talk reinforces some existing uses of power as Foucauldian ( Reference Geuss 2013 , 103), but unlike Geuss, Foucault maintains that the way institutions invariably overstep their own legitimizing rules also opens up possibilities for resistance. If relations of force can be naturalized and legitimized by the discourse of right, they can also be undone by turning rights talk against itself for liberatory ends; as he says in the context of gay rights, for example, “[r]ather than arguing that rights are fundamental and natural to the individual, we should try to imagine and create a new relational right that permits all possible types of relations to exist and not be prevented, blocked, or annulled by impoverished relational institutions” ( Reference Foucault and Rabinow 1997 , 158). Against Williams\'s and Moyn\'s suggestion that human rights be stripped of their utopian aspirations and Geuss\'s view that they be avoided entirely, Foucault suggests that imagining and claiming new rights can facilitate better political action. The impracticability of a global revolt to prevent human rights violations doesn\'t legitimate state intervention in its place; instead, this vision lends support to existing social movements assisting refugees while simultaneously drawing our attention to how a radically different world is required for people to genuinely enjoy their human rights. Such utopian thinking does not require us to detach ourselves from the world we actually live in, as Geuss feared, but instead takes seriously existing practices that can point to ideals beyond it. While, in the abstract, to claim a right may be a way of asserting something inviolable, in practice, weaker parties claiming or asserting rights against more powerful parties are doing something quite different. Rights demands can also be assertions, seizures, and even performances of the very rights being demanded (Ingram Reference Ingram 2013 ), as Malcolm X\'s use of human rights shows. Human rights were at the center of his political thinking following his departure from the Nation of Islam in 1964 and, prior to his assassination in 1965, he toured Africa and Europe for months to promote his plan to petition the United Nations to protest the U.S.’s violation of African-Americans’ human rights (Harris Reference Harris, Conyers and Smallwood 2008 ; Temkin Reference Temkin 2012 ). He explained the value of human rights as an orientation to politics when he claimed that “[t]he difference between the thinking and the scope of the Negroes who are involved in the human-rights struggle and those who are involved in the civil-rights struggle is that those so-called Negroes involved in the human-rights struggle don\'t look upon themselves as Americans. They look upon themselves as a part of dark mankind” ( Reference X and Breitman 1990 , 51–2; see also 34–6). In distinguishing human rights from civil rights, Malcolm X recognizes that some rights claims can play the pacifying and status-quo-preserving role that the realists identify. But far from asserting an a priori universality, he used human rights claims specifically to polarize and assert difference, constructing a new political identity by refusing identification with the state and drawing attention to its repressive power. Rather than assuming that everyone has the same relation to human rights, Malcolm X argues that African-Americans have a particular political aim in claiming them: to undermine state power by appealing beyond it, to “dark mankind.” He came to see human rights as the most effective political vehicle for an avowedly utopian Pan-Africanism, a desirable and impracticable form of unity among people of African descent throughout the world (Smith Reference Smith 1991 ). As with Foucault, the political efficacy of Malcolm X\'s vision does not depend on the possibility of realizing it. Regardless of whether “dark mankind” will ever exist as a unitary political force, the vision of it can nevertheless powerfully shape the self-understanding of political actors and facilitate new possibilities of action. In his view, civil rights advocates are ineffective because their identification with American citizenship has oriented them away from recognizing the way that white supremacy exercises power through institutions with which they identify; identification with “dark mankind” would better orient them to the operation of that power and to identify their own interests more readily. In his letter to the heads of state of the countries belonging to the Organization of African Unity, he likewise argues that a human rights framework would better orient them to the role of white supremacy in global politics and dispose them to an alliance with African-Americans: “You will never be fully respected until and unless we are also respected. . . . Our problem is your problem. It is not a Negro problem, nor an American problem. This is a world problem; a problem for humanity. It is not a problem of civil rights but a problem of human rights” ( Reference X and Breitman 1990 , 75). Where Geuss sees human rights as weakening social movements by orienting its adherents to individual victims, Malcolm X\'s act of claiming human rights is itself an assertion of collective political power and agency that makes it possible to track power and perceive political possibilities—in this case, for transnational solidarity—that might otherwise be overlooked. The realists acknowledge that we do not know the limits of what is possible in politics. Geuss says that offering responsible answers to political questions means “thinking about them in a space organized around possible alternatives to the present existing state of affairs” ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 39) and Williams affirms that “we should explore what more radical and ambitious forms of participatory or deliberative democracy are possible” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 17). Yet exploring the space of possible alternatives requires utopian thinking that can help us to see new possibilities in the present, even if the worlds they describe are impracticable. Foucault\'s “international citizenry” may not literally rise against every abuse of power internationally, but his invocation of such a world illuminates opportunities for direct action; Malcolm X\'s use of human rights to orient African-Americans towards identifying with “dark mankind” rather than American citizenship similarly points political action down new paths for transnational solidarity. The end of the Cold War has only amplified the importance of nonstate actors in world politics and these oppositional utopias offer a model of how effective orientations to such a complex world might be imagined. Realism stands against the belief that we can have it all and, to combat that kind of wishful thinking, foregrounds the idea that a responsible politics entails accepting some loss. Moyn applies this thought to human rights and suggests that “in the long view, the search for rights beyond [the state] may have been at a considerable price: the loss of the inclusive space of membership that the concrete state, and even empire, had long provided in some form or other” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 42). I do not wish to contest Moyn\'s historical judgment, but to suggest that this nostalgia for the nation-state provides a poor model for orienting us effectively to whatever liberatory political possibilities there may be now. It is true that the UDHR does not provide a blueprint for addressing the economic inequality that concerns Moyn and Geuss, but as I have argued, the primary practical use of utopian thinking is not its application. Assuming otherwise leads Moyn to dismiss the use of human rights by Malcolm X and other African-American radicals as “a minor feature of a larger anticolonialism” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 106) because their plans were not put into action, but that mistakes their value. Their uses of human rights model the possibility of utopian thinking orienting people to political interests that more minimal views overlook. If one aims to orient people to a shared interest in opposing inequality in the global economy today, it is important to ask what better accomplishes this: utopian visions of a world where everyone enjoys periodic holidays with pay or Moyn\'s return to a national framework, which disposes adherents to see their interests in competition with other countries? As this suggests, a realist politics is not exempt from its own insight that every political choice entails a loss; for a politics that begins with the way existing institutions operate, it will always seem dubious for the powerless to oppose the plans of those in power. If realists want political theory to do its part in intervening to stop catastrophe, then they would do well to consider all the tools available to them. AN EFFECTIVELY UTOPIAN ORIENTATION? Foucault and Malcolm X illustrate how we can appreciate utopian thinking as a source of orientation to the present rather than as a blueprint for the future and so avoid the pervasive dissatisfactions that have characterized evaluations of utopia\'s political efficacy since the Cold War. In closing, I want to consider an alternative way of practicing political theory in light of these oppositional utopians as well as the realist critique of applying utopian thinking. Where ideal theory as blueprint fixes the future and then proclaims that we should march towards a predetermined destination, a view of ideal theory as orientation suggests that a utopia isn\'t worth pursuing if it can\'t orient us to the here and now. I develop this view by considering John Rawls, whom the realists identify as their leading contemporary opponent. While realists correctly note that Rawls\'s view lacks an adequate conception of power, they overlook the fact that Rawls specifically asserted that “[n]either political philosophy nor justice as fairness. . .is applied moral philosophy” ( Reference Rawls and Kelly 2001a , 14). Attending to this surprising strand in Rawls\'s work not only reverses a common interpretation of his thought (as suggested by the fact that Simmons and Pogge take themselves to be following Rawls), but also provides a useful framework for extending the force of utopian thinking in political theory today. In a 1983 lecture, Rawls said, “Williams is right that there can be no ethical theory as he describes it, that is, a philosophical structure which together with some degree of empirical fact, yields a decision procedure for moral reasoning. . .Perhaps, though, while it cannot provide a decision procedure, it can provide something else” (Forrester Reference Forrester 2012 , 264). What can it provide? In Justice as Fairness: A Restatement , Rawls strikingly calls orientation one of the primary aims of political philosophy. He writes, “the members of any civilized society need a conception that enables them to understand themselves as members having a certain political status—in a democracy, that of equal citizenship—and how this status affects their relation to their social world. This need political philosophy may try to answer, and this role I call that of orientation” ( Reference Rawls and Kelly 2001a , 2–3). Like the realists, Rawls\'s account of orientation is contextual rather than a priori and he endorses the idea that facilitating action requires knowledge of one\'s social world and the way that legitimating ideas shape political statuses in that world. Footnote 11 Rawls emphasizes orientation as a response to a particular practical obstacle to political action; in a modern social world characterized by complex systems of interdependence, it is impossible for most people to understand fully how their actions contribute to their society and in turn rely on the contributions of others. In order to be appropriately responsive to others in this context, individuals need to understand themselves as playing a particular role. But equal citizenship is only one orienting role. One of the tasks of utopian thinking today is to propose more such roles to guide political action that involves those who are not officially co-citizens, as Foucault and Malcolm X attempted with their respective invocations of “international citizenry” and “dark mankind.” Of course, even people in actually existing democracies do not enjoy genuinely equal citizenship. How then could Rawls\'s utopian invocation of genuinely equal citizenship orient us effectively to an unjust present? Geuss and Williams acknowledge that society is always a mixture of cooperation and conflict, but take it as a given that a responsible orientation must direct political actors to attend to the pervasiveness of conflict and thus the fragility of order. Rawls proposes an alternative orientation to these same facts. The most effective means of managing conflict may not be to insist on its centrality or inevitability. According to Rawls, we are much more likely to maintain a social order when we orient ourselves to other members of society as individuals with equal status with whom we share some interests (e.g., maintaining order) even as we conflict in other areas. His view is that we may avoid repeating our violent history if we habitually attend to the benefits from being in society and interpret society as a cooperative project with others as equal partners. This doesn\'t mean Rawls is so naïve as to think that all Americans currently enjoy truly equal political status ( Reference Rawls and Kelly 2001a , 136–40). Neither does such a suggestion presuppose an end to conflict (Rawls Reference Rawls 1996 , xviii–xix and 54–8). Instead we might interpret Rawls along the lines suggested by Williams\'s distinction between politics and domination (Jubb Reference Jubb 2015 ); attending to the way that political disagreements presuppose the renunciation of domination may make such disagreements more amenable to resolution. By orienting ourselves to those institutions and practices where values are partially and imperfectly instantiated in the world, we are better able to act in ways that promote the fuller realization of those values. For Rawls as for the realists, a political theory fails when it tends to produce actions with effects that are contrary to the values that the theory promotes. In that sense, the normativity is immanent to the orientation rather than directing it from outside. If being oriented by Rawls\'s utopian vision does not dispose its adherents to actions that promote equality in our society, then it will have failed by its own lights. And Rawls\'s vision should be faulted on these terms. While the realists misunderstand the nature of their dispute with Rawls, they are right that he fails to develop a language to talk about power that would make it possible to orient one\'s actions to it (PRP, 90). Rawls\'s own ideal theory avoids offering an a priori interpretation of institutions as Kant does, but is nevertheless left profoundly one-sided; it provides a way to see the value in existing institutions without a means to analyze their problems. But attending to power can change our fundamental interpretation of existing institutions. As Malcolm X suggested, deciding whether or not American institutions even partially instantiate the value of equality rather than using it as ideological cover for white supremacy requires judgments about both empirical and normative matters. Through the idea of ideal theory as orientation, Rawls illuminates what effective utopian thinking can be today, though his own theory falls regrettably short. If the search for replacement utopias that began 25 years ago is ever to come to an end, it will not be because the right blueprints are finally discovered nor because people decide to put aside their utopian hopes entirely. To end this prolonged impasse in which utopia seems both necessary and impossible, we need to change what we are searching for. Geuss and Williams show us that political theory should not offer a plan, but an orientation; however, they unduly constrain the politics of their intervention by suggesting that utopia has no appropriate role to play as a source of orientation. I have argued that utopian thinking can and should aim at developing orientations that both facilitate a realistic power analysis of existing institutions and attend to the utopian paths made possible by those institutions’ partial and deeply imperfect instantiations of values like equality, freedom, and human rights. If political thinking and political action are to be productively linked, both realism and utopia are essential today."}, {\'title\': \'What Makes a Utopia Inconvenient?

Although New Harmony was propagandized as a symbol for equality of the sexes, its women had different opinions on what the community actually offered to them. Some women found new freedoms but most of them experienced increased demands on their timeworn domestic services. Some women, especially those from working-class backgrounds, felt that their situation was bettered by the move, however, the majority of the women often felt betrayed by false promises of equality that brought them mostly demeaning labor. It was difficult to meet the wants and expectations of so many different people. I think the take home from this failure of unification in the society directly parallels all of the other utopian societies we have read about . Utopian thinkers wanted to be able to create a society in which all races, classes and genders came together and lived harmoniously. Unfortunately, as we have seen all too often during our class research, bringing all of these different people together, with completely different backgrounds, initiated the breakdown of the society. One connection I could make between Robert Owen’s New Harmony and Thomas More’s Utopia , although fairly unrelated to topic of unity above, is how the traditional view of gender roles seemed to permeate the thinking of these male utopian leaders. Thomas More referred to women, bluntly, as “the weaker sex” (More 60), and gave them more simple jobs that required less strength, such as weaving, while the men passed their time with carpentry or metal work. Although a minor example, Thomas More degraded women by providing them with smaller tasks, although most of the women were just as able to perform the tasks that men did. Although they claimed to be forward thinking and driven by peace and equality, many utopian thinkers did not consider the lives of women to be as important as the lives of men. Work Cited: More, T.

When taking that experience as exemplary, political estimations of utopia tend to oscillate between two extremes. Many worry that utopian thinking can swamp politics when it provides a radical social blueprint and inspires adherents to implement it mechanically (Kateb Reference Kateb 1972 ). On the other hand, utopian thinking that fails to resemble a radical blueprint is dismissed as toothless, either because it cannot be applied to practical politics or because it all too closely resembles politics as it already is (Shklar Reference Shklar and Hoffmann 1998 ). Consequently, utopia is understood to have either too much or too little political force and so new replacement utopias—especially “The Last Utopia” of human rights—are invariably found wanting (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 ). Perhaps as a result, the past decade has seen the striking rise of a realism that scorns utopian blueprints alongside attempts to decouple Marxism from the end of the Soviet Union in order to recuperate “The Idea of Communism” (Dsouzinas and Zizek Reference Dsouzinas and Zizek 2010 ). In this article, I argue that a profound misunderstanding of how political theory can relate to political practice lies behind this prolonged crisis of utopianism. Contemporary political realism offers an important critique of utopian thinking that shows why attempts to apply it appear too strong or weak; however, rather than dismissing or marginalizing utopianism, as the realists themselves do, I show how their critique can illuminate its genuine utility. When one abandons the expectation that the political force of utopias must manifest itself through attempts at application and instead considers how they can orient political actors to existing institutions, one can see utopian thinking making effective interventions by disrupting entrenched forms of legitimation, fostering new forms of identity, and revealing new potentials within existing institutional forms. These are important political and theoretical possibilities and we have good reason to value their liberatory potential on realist grounds. Utopias take many forms, but for purposes of this argument, I will use utopian thinking to refer to depictions of or reflections on highly desirable and hoped-for social and political circumstances that include no necessary reference to the means, costs, or feasibility of achieving them from our present condition. Utopian thinking does not need to imagine a perfect society—historically, it rarely does (Sargent Reference Sargent 2010 , 104)—but can, for example, envision worlds in which some contemporary problems are simply absent without proposing a plan for bringing that about. The charge that utopian thinking fails to engage appropriately with the practice of actual politics is a very old complaint—it is aimed at Socrates throughout Plato\'s Republic —but works by Raymond Geuss and Bernard Williams published over the past decade have given it new life by suggesting that the need for realism is especially timely in light of the contemporary search for new replacement utopias. Footnote 1 It is a measure of the influence of this critique that many old thinkers are now returning to prominence under the realist banner, their ideas freshly re-certified as practical and nonutopian (Ciccariello-Maher Reference Ciccariello-Maher 2014 ; Mantena Reference Mantena 2012 ). Political realists have unsurprisingly raised a variety of concerns about utopias, but the complaint that I consider here is that utopian thinking fails to orient us to our actual circumstances and problems. As I will use the term, an orientation to politics concerns how we get our bearings in our social world by identifying those features we habitually regard as the most salient parts of the landscape and which we are consequently disposed to weigh in our considered judgment about what to do. Footnote 2 Geuss and Williams argue that utopian thinking is constitutively unable to orient people properly to politics because of its theoretical methodology, which determines what is desirable or valuable without any reference to the particular political choices faced by really existing actors. For example, theorizing a world in which human rights are universally respected doesn\'t seem to make it easier to cope with a world in which the content of human rights is the subject of deep disagreement and in which the selective enforcement of human rights is used to advance national interests. Against thinking that is fundamentally unworldly and encouraging of illusions, Geuss and Williams suggest that we should be attuned above all to how people actually are and how politics really works so that we can be better oriented and take more effective political action. To the extent that they accord utopian thinking any beneficial practical role, it is as a source of motivation for engaging in politics, but never guiding how to do so. Geuss and Williams have importantly different views in many respects, including about politics, but their work is united in polemically suggesting that the most important distinction in contemporary political thought and practice is between realists and others. In the profusion of secondary literature responding to Geuss and Williams and carrying their work forward, surprisingly few have asked, how should their realism be evaluated on its own terms—that is, not only as a theoretical view but also as a political intervention ? I will argue that the resultant orientation to politics is unnecessarily limited. Importantly, my argument differs from defenses of utopian thinking which take impractical political thought as a worthwhile end in itself (e.g., Estlund Reference Estlund 2011 ). Using human rights as a case study, I show how realist critiques have obscured the emancipatory potential of regarding them as a utopian project. Political projects advancing human rights are not necessarily utopian, but imagining a world in which “the dignity of each individual will enjoy secure international protection” through the realization of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is surely what historian and human rights critic Samuel Moyn calls “a recognizably utopian program” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 1). Against the assumption—shared by Geuss, Williams, and Moyn alike—that the adherents of such utopian visions understand them as blueprints to be applied in practice, I argue that envisioning an ideal society need not be a precursor to attempts to build it. Rather, as I show by analyzing the uses of human rights by Malcolm X and Michel Foucault, utopian thinking can orient us to existing political institutions in ways that both track the operations of power and attend to real opportunities for resistance. Through a counterintuitive reading of John Rawls\'s account of orientation, I argue that even an impossible-to-realize ideal theory can help us understand important features of our present circumstances. In short, a realism that seeks to facilitate effective political action should recognize its own interdependence with utopian thinking. Realism usefully highlights the cost of every political choice, but often overlooks the costs associated with adopting realism itself; an insistence on seeing things as they are can easily curdle into an insistence that things are as they must be, especially because new political possibilities are both risky and difficult to perceive. It is here that utopias retain their political force. No longer understood simply as blueprints for action or principles to be applied mechanically, utopias can give us a novel perspective on our own politics valuable on realist grounds. THE POLITICS OF PRIORITIZING IDEAL THEORY The project of defending utopian thinking on realist grounds may seem quixotic in light of what many take to be their obvious opposition. For example, William Galston begins his explanation of political realism with what he calls “the least surprising point—namely, realism\'s resolutely antiutopian stance” (Galston Reference Galston 2010 , 394; see also Jubb Reference Jubb 2015 , 920). However, others perceive a more complicated relation; Enzo Rossi and Matt Sleat contend that “conceptually, nothing precludes realists from resurrecting the 1968 slogan ‘Be realistic. Demand the impossible’” (Rossi and Sleat Reference Rossi and Sleat 2014 , 690), even if few have actually done so in practice. Consequently, it is important to be specific about the particular realist objection to utopian thinking that I want to consider. In contrast to the tradition of thinking about politics that sees theorizing as pursuing truths that are essentially separate from political action, a realist approach focuses on how theories are lived now, as they shape ways of seeing the existing political world by drawing our attention to particular features of it. That habitual attention naturally leads political agents to act in particular ways, as some actions appear appropriate to the perceived environment while others become almost unthinkable. As Geuss puts it, “My interest is in the practical coherence of a certain general framework for orienting political action in the contemporary world” (Geuss Reference Geuss 2001 , vii; hereafter, “HIP”). One of the strengths of this view is that a framework for orientation can draw from many different resources, including not only political theory but also other practices, like human rights, that shape our expectations of politics. Thus, for realists, the key question of political theory is not “what would an ideal society look like?” Rather, they ask, “what kind of political thinking will orient people most coherently and effectively to intervene in politics?” For Geuss, the answer is clear: . . .political philosophy must be realist. That means, roughly speaking, that it must start from and be concerned in the first instance not with how people ought ideally (or ought ‘rationally’) to act, what they ought to desire, or value, the kind of people they ought to be, etc., but, rather, with the way the social, economic, political, etc., institutions actually operate in some society at some given time, and what really does move human beings to act in given circumstances. ( Reference Geuss 2008 , 9; hereafter, “PRP”) Rather than putting ideals first, Geuss wants to put the facts first (bracketing for now the question of where exactly ideals go). Political actors that fail to do this—whether they draw those ideals from political theory or the UDHR—will almost certainly not promote their intended ends since they will habitually overlook the most important features of their circumstances. In this section, I consider Geuss\'s account of utopian thinking in political theory as a source of disorientation before turning to the role of utopian thinking in the political project of human rights next. Geuss offered a particularly vivid symbol of his critique with the holiday card that he reportedly sent in 2004 juxtaposing portraits of Immanuel Kant and John Rawls with images of George W. Bush and prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib (Worsnip Reference Worsnip 2013 ). Understanding how and why Geuss connects these philosophers to actions that they would plainly deplore will clarify the nature and limits of his analysis of utopian thinking\'s relation to orientation. Footnote 3 In order to motivate action after the horrors of Holocaust, Rawls constructs a “realistic utopia” in which justice is fully realized “someday, somewhere” (Rawls Reference Rawls 2001b , 127). But Geuss dismisses this consoling vision. Footnote 4 In 2003, he asked rhetorically about Rawls, “Are reflections about the correct distribution of goods and service in a ‘well-ordered society’ the right kind of intellectual response to slavery, torture, and mass murder?” (Geuss Reference Geuss 2005 , 31) To think about a utopia free of unjustifiable inequality is to miss the most pressing political problems that have to be faced now and, to that extent, may be complicit in their perpetuation. Who needs utopia when you can\'t even prevent a catastrophe? It may seem obvious that theorizing an ideal future would not orient its adherents to pressing contemporary problems, but Geuss\'s point is not merely that the utopian ambitions of egalitarian liberals distract them from preventing disaster, in the mode of Judith Shklar\'s “liberalism of fear” (Shklar Reference Shklar and Hoffmann 1998 ). Rather, Geuss argues that their understanding of the relationship between political thinking and political action disposes them to disorientation because of the conception of normativity they employ. Geuss refers to these alternatives to realism as “ethics-first” thinking, writing, “[t]he view I am rejecting assumes that one can complete the work of ethics first, attaining an ideal theory of how we should act, and then in a second step, one can apply that ideal theory to the action of political agents” (PRP, 8). Geuss believes that these two features necessarily go together: (i) Normative Priority : employing normative values whose relevance and importance are determined without any reference to the particular problems the thinker encounters in politics. (ii) Politics as Application : understanding political practice as the application of a theory developed independently of engagement with politics itself. On this view, the only possible use of a utopian vision whose normative desirability purports to transcend its circumstances is to serve as a blueprint for realizing that vision. While I will argue later that these two steps are in fact separable, Geuss is right that some of the most prominent contemporary forms of political theorizing conjoin both features to troubling effect. In particular, many practitioners of ideal theory do produce “realistic utopias” that they take as blueprints, conceiving of political practice as an attempt to approximate an ideal theory of just social institutions. For those who engage in ideal theory as blueprint , normative priority is given to the envisioned future and present actions are oriented around it; if a present political opportunity appears incompatible with the utopian future, then that is all one needs to know in order to reject it. As A. John Simmons writes, “We, as theorists of justice, simply should not care which policies are politically possible (etcetera) unless those policies are also on an acceptable path to a just institutional structure” ( Reference Simmons 2010 , 34). Yet despite being identified as the aim of political practice, the desirability of the ideal future is determined without any reference to the means or costs of achieving of it; Thomas Pogge articulates the methodology of many such political philosophers when he makes a sharp distinction between the project of constructing an ideal theory and the challenges of realizing that vision, writing, “I say little about transition problems: about how the ideal society can be reached from where we are now, and what demands justice imposes on the transition” ( Reference Pogge and Kosch 2007 , page x). Tragic choices among constrained options have no obvious role to play in the view. Despite this, political action today can be guided directly by a utopian future because it is there that the normative values that one should promote today are worked out. For example, in his theory of global justice, Luis Cabrera writes, “My claim is that, with a defensible set of global institutions in mind—one which plausibly would secure the rights of all persons—we can extrapolate duties that would apply in the present global system, including ones to move institutions closer to the target” ( Reference Cabrera 2010 , 67). If I want to figure out what to do within the present global system, I look first of all to an envisioned future and only then to existing institutions. For ideal theory as blueprint, existing politics appears primarily as imposing obstacles to achieving an ideal rather than as a realm with its own dynamics to be respected. Existing political institutions are accordingly either overlooked entirely or understood as having an a priori relation to the values that the view promotes. Such theories thereby offer idealized pictures of institutions where their flaws appear as correctable deviations from a conceptual model; in contrast, a realist analysis begins by observing the operations of power and thus bases its interpretation of existing institutions on their actual functioning. A key example here is the state. Consider Kant\'s conception of rights and justice, which Geuss provocatively links with Abu Ghraib. In his political writings, Kant argues that the rational state makes justice possible by making rights stable and enforceable in the world. Kant further argues that, because having a state enforce one\'s rights is a practical precondition to being able to enjoy those rights, the state\'s action through the rule of law cannot be an infringement on my rights and freedom so long as it is enforced equally and in good faith. Footnote 5 On this interpretation, Kant uses an a priori argument to establish the universal rationality of the state, an actually existing institution in the world. This has significant effects on any resultant orientation to politics, making the state appear as a fixed point rather than a historically contingent development. We seem to already know in advance a state\'s most important features without having to inspect it. Geuss is rightly concerned about the effects of this since it tends to obscure the actual workings of power and to misunderstand the choices in front of us. This also has the status-quo-preserving effect of making it easy to justify states’ existence and (often dubious) actions. So, while it may be hyperbolic to link Kant with the abuses of Abu Ghraib, it is plausible for Geuss to argue that Kant\'s view orients him to politics in a way that presumptively legitimizes state violence and directs attention away from the costs of creating and maintaining order. Any utopian thinking that reduces politics to a venue for the unmediated application of a priori normative values risks doing the same. Geuss\'s critique illuminates why utopian thinking today appears too strong and too weak when we consider implementing it. On one hand, utopian thinking is too ambitious in describing an ideal without any attention to the means to realize it; to attend in the first instance to the features of an ideal future disposes the visionary to acts ill-suited to his surroundings. On the other hand, utopian thinking is not ambitious enough because the ideals described too closely resemble the world as it already is (Geuss Reference Geuss 2010a , 429). While the values and ideals they hold up are meant to have been developed without any necessary reference to our contingent circumstances, “[u]topian thinking assumes that we have too much cognitive ability to detach ourselves from the world we actually live in, to ‘jump over our own shadow’ as Hegel put it” and, as a result, “[turns] out to have the same basic defects of the present, merely magnified” (Geuss Reference Geuss, Stoecker and Iorio 2015 , 155). The visions of just societies produced by contemporary egalitarian liberals have the same methodological problems as Kant\'s conception of the state; attempting to develop ideal theories of just institutions without first understanding the way real institutions operate produces utopias that, at best, do nothing to address real defects and, at worst, mistake existing flaws for fixed points of the social world. Utopian thinking thus fails to provide an appropriate orientation to politics twice over—first, because it misidentifies the most salient features of a situation; second, because it leads the utopian thinker to misunderstand the character of his own agency and ideals. UTOPIAN THINKING IN POLITICAL PRACTICE For Geuss, ideal theory as blueprint represents the problem with utopian thinking in political theory, but it is human rights that exemplifies the pitfalls of utopian thinking in political practice. Though most human rights advocates do not have fully articulated philosophical methods and see themselves as responding directly to urgent crises, Geuss argues that they nevertheless advance ethics-first views. Advocates misunderstand how rights function in the world because, in order to make rights inviolable and urgent, they have given those rights a normative status that cannot be affected by empirical developments. Footnote 6 On Geuss\'s view, the very idea of right requires that ethics “come first”; rights are meant to be respected in every circumstance, rendering the specifics of the situation of secondary importance. The practical failure to respect a human right does not undermine the normativity of the right; on the contrary, it only makes it more important to claim the right, often with perverse effects. Geuss highlights three specific ways that the ethics-first orientation provided by a human rights framework ignores important features of politics and thereby facilitates ineffective action. First, the utopian vision of a world where everyone\'s human rights are protected is premised on denying the fact that political action always has a cost. How would conflicts among the rights enumerated there be resolved? Can such a world be achieved without violating human rights along the way? Do we have enough resources for everyone to enjoy the right to “periodic holidays with pay” asserted in Article 24 of UDHR? Geuss argues that there are no good answers to these questions because human rights are an “inconvenient fiction” that relies on “a fantastically optimistic view about God, the world, natural resources, and the avoidability of conflict” (HIP, 149). Geuss sees those who reject realism as wanting to have it all and asserts instead that “[p]olitics as we know it is a matter of differential choice: opting for A rather than B” and doing so at an advantageous time (PRP, 30, emphasis original). Lacking an orientation to the dichotomous nature of political choices, advocates are disposed to intervene in politics in ways dictated by their normative ideal rather than by evaluating the costs of competing options. In the face of a brutal dictator abroad, advocates are likely to say, “We have to do something!” because they assume that there must be something we can do when rights are violated. As a result of their utopian ideal, they are oriented to the situation in a way that leads them away from considering the possibility that the costs of “doing something” may be higher than the costs of doing nothing. Second, Geuss thinks that the ethics-first nature of an orientation to human rights ensures that advocates overlook power and have an incoherent relation to institutions and enforcement. Since the UDHR has no institution charged with its implementation, Geuss dismisses human rights as “no more than a moralizing conception about what would be desirable without any concrete specification of an enforcing agency” (HIP, 142). Instead, enforcement is left to states, which is foolish at best when we know that states overrule human rights all the time when it is convenient for their purposes (HIP, 148). Insisting that human rights be protected by states only gives them a further tool to legitimate their violence and, since states are the primary violators as well as the primary protectors of rights, Geuss thinks that this problem is insoluble. The disjuncture between how rights operate in our world, where powerful actors use them to advance their ends, and how they would operate in a utopia, where everyone\'s rights would be protected by impartial global mechanisms, is symptomatic of the way ethics-first orientations dispose people to overlook the centrality of power in politics. Third, human rights doctrine orients its adherents to mistake their own character as political agents. In a recent interview, Geuss said, “To give priority to claiming rights gives us the completely wrong attitude toward ourselves, other political agencies and the state because it basically prioritizes us as passive clients of the nanny-state” ( Reference Geuss 2013 , 93). Human rights orient us to politics in a way that emphasizes the agency of states and the passivity of individuals without any tools for thinking about other forms of political organization or action since they lack a priori normative status. By taking individuals as the primary object of concern, the human rights framework relies on a “tacit (and utterly implausible form of) atomistic individualism” ( Reference Geuss 2013 , 93) that leads to ineffective political mobilization and facilitates state control. Demanding human rights entails understanding injustice as primarily a wrong done to individuals, which disposes people to respond as solitary victims. In short, like egalitarian liberal ideal theories, the human rights utopia articulated by the UDHR and its proponents describes a desirable world without any reference to the means for its achievement while its hodgepodge of goals seem to aim simultaneously too high and too low. A right to holidays with pay may seem not merely unrealistic but irrelevant in a world where a billion people live on a dollar a day. At the same time, even global protection of the rights in the UDHR would fall short of a genuine utopia. Observing that the rise of the human rights movement in recent decades has accompanied the growth of economic inequality, Samuel Moyn notes in a Geussian spirit, “even were all the dreams of international human rights movements to be fulfilled, it is as much low ambitions as failures to realize them that made human rights companions of market fundamentalism” ( Reference Moyn, Lettinga and van Troost 2015 , 15). In light of such problems, Geuss argues that, for anyone properly oriented to contemporary politics, the “last utopia” of human rights would not appear worth pursuing. So, does Geuss believe that the point of political theory is simply to describe what politics is, counsel acceptance of it, and encourage quiescence? It can sound like this, as when Geuss calls his view “basically Hobbesian” (PRP, 22). But this is too simple. His realism chastens our normative ambitions by warning us away from utopian aspirations that take stability for granted or rest on an impossible agreement about values. As a consequence of this turn to the possible, his realism also chastens our methodological ambitions by exhorting us to remain close to the actual effects of power in our analysis, since such knowledge will be more useful for addressing the political choices we face. But Geuss imagines these Hobbesian requirements on theorizing to have liberatory potential: “Suppose now we decided to abandon the narrow limitations imposed on us by traditional ideas of what a ‘philosophical ethics’ could (and must) be. Then one could imagine ways of orienting ourselves in the world which went beyond the sorts of things envisaged and discussed in traditional forms of ethics” ( Reference Geuss 2014 , 192). Geuss sees realism not as an irksome constraint on the kinds of political theories we should offer, but as making possible a better kind of thinking and acting; one who adopts realism has simply been freed from illusory and impossible desires. We may not be able to achieve utopia, but perhaps, once we have left it behind, we will be able to see new possibilities that are good in their own ways. REALISM AS A GUIDE TO ACTION? Geuss makes a persuasive case that, in some important instances, utopian thinking orients its adherents to politics in a way that leads to incoherent, ineffective action. But Geuss\'s critique also raises difficult issues for his own alternative approach. Recall that he identifies ethics-first thinking as having two steps, first identifying a normative value and then applying it without attending to some essential features of politics. Because he sees the second step necessarily following from the first, Geuss suggests that the root of the problem with how ethics-first thinking guides political action is its conception of normative values. But does realism offer an alternative means of judging what to do? Realists who accept Geuss\'s critique have essentially three paths to choose from: (1) realism could simply serve as a corrective for other views; (2) realism could guide action without providing normative evaluations; or (3) realism could provide its own conception of normative evaluation. If political realism is content to be merely a corrective, then it can let the other views supply the normative values and suggest either that the means to pursue those ends are unrealistic or that the values cannot be fully realized. On this reading, human rights doctrine is inconvenient by its own lights; realism does not offer a substantive or methodological alternative so much as it acts as a permanent gadfly, assessing the coherence of other positions without offering any distinctive values of its own. A realism of this kind is an ethos or what Mark Philp calls “more like a code of honor. . .[than] a set of metatheoretical claims” ( Reference Philp 2012 , 637). A realism that refuses to be action-guiding could still be prescriptive in the sense that it counsels a clear-eyed confrontation with reality without having anything to say about what happens after that confrontation. This ethos typically narrates its bearer as a kind of tragic hero, one both freed by knowing the truth but also cursed to bear the opprobrium of those whose illusions he shatters. In these moods, Geuss also identifies his position with Theodor Adorno\'s; some circumstances require taking up a “merely negative” attitude without providing any reason to think shattered illusions can be replaced ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 9). Yet Geuss often makes stronger claims for realism and suggests that it can facilitate better, more effective political action on its own. In places, he even suggests that realism should lead directly to some quite particular courses of action, such as “[fostering] further European integration” ( Reference Geuss 2010a , 28). But how does one judge possible political actions without appealing to some values that they would promote? Sometimes Geuss suggests that once one adopts his perspective, its virtues will become evident (PRP, 17). That would be a doubly optimistic kind of realism, since it implies both an epistemic optimism that we have a reasonably reliable access to reality and a practical optimism that changing the way we talk about that reality will make things go better (Honig and Stears Reference Honig, Stears, Floyd and Stears 2011 ). Such optimism runs counter to Geuss\'s own insistence on the persistence of disagreement. Even those who adopt a realist orientation to politics will surely offer competing interpretations of events, discern different possibilities for action, and seek to promote diverse ends. Geuss erases this pluralism when he conflates orientation and normative evaluation. While adopting political realism may suffice to rule out certain actions as self-defeating, it is rarely enough to defend the affirmative choice of a particular action. If Geuss wants to offer a free-standing approach to political thinking (and it is not always clear that he does), then such a realism needs to be able to make explicit the value of the actions that it promotes. Consider the pressing political question of how the EU and its citizens should relate to a country abusing human rights. Geuss asserts that the EU should embrace China “in the interest of collaboration on the long-term goal of demilitarizing international politics” ( Reference Geuss 2010a , 29). This is surely a worthy goal, but if political action should promote this aim, how does realism really differ from utopian thinking? Geuss acknowledges that “[i]t is a value judgment of a kind to think that a world in which the use of extreme military force is routine is, other things being equal, less good than one in which the use of force is uncommon” ( Reference Geuss 2010a , 30). Geuss seeks to make his judgment more limited than the human rights advocate\'s by introducing a comparative element; he does not suggest, for example, that making military force uncommon is the sole end of politics and that all actions failing to promote this end are thereby impermissible. But the insufficiency of Geuss\'s conception of normative values is made clear by the phrase “other things being equal.” If the EU were to abandon its alliance with the US to become closer to China, other things would not remain equal. In deciding to do so, the EU would surely need to make a judgment about how to weigh the other values at stake; concerns for the environment, prosperity, free speech, and stability may all pull in different directions. But because Geuss\'s criticism of utopian thinking assumes that prioritizing particular normative values leads directly to an orientation to politics as an application of those values, he minimizes his own reliance on normative values and does not address how to weigh them. Rejecting an implausibly univocal realism thus puts Geuss in a bind: if he is to be entitled to the substantive political claims he wants to make (no to human rights, yes to an EU-China alliance), Geuss must reject his own methodological criticism of utopian thinking. Alternatively, he could rest content as a gadfly or, more dramatically, renounce the claim to facilitate better actions and say that a truly realist orientation reveals all our political actions to be equally meaningless. Geuss has oscillated among these positions, moving from an almost nihilistic despair to a measured appreciation of utopian thinking and back again. In the former vein, Geuss memorably stated that “[w]e are not, of course, now in a situation in which it is realistically possible for us to envisage any fundamental change in our world which we could ourselves bring about by our own efforts” ( Reference Geuss 2014 , 194). This politics of futility really does suggest that our actions do not much matter and, as a result, even the value of a clear-eyed confrontation with reality becomes doubtful. However, in other moods, he has written that realism is not necessarily antiutopian ( Reference Geuss Geuss 2010b) and has gone so far as to say that “unless one thinks that we already live in the best of all possible worlds and that lack of flexibility in our relation to our own future is a good thing, giving up our utopian impulses completely would represent a serious loss” ( Reference Geuss, Stoecker and Iorio 2015 , 158). Shadowed by the worry that utopian thinking will result in the reduction of politics to enacting blueprints, Geuss carefully refers to “utopian impulses,” the content of which remains elusive, rather than utopian thinking, which provides more determinate content. Footnote 7 Instead of seeing utopia as a potential aid to orientation, Geuss locates its practical political function elsewhere as when, in a discussion of Gustav Landauer, he notes that “utopian impulses are motivationally essential” ( Reference Geuss, Stoecker and Iorio 2015 , 156). But this raises the question, what will adherents of utopia be motivated to do? Without articulating an alternative practical use for them, those who rely on utopias to motivate engagement in politics will likely default to applying them as blueprints—precisely what Geuss wants to avoid. Consequently, we must look elsewhere for a realist account of the use of utopian thinking that can supplant the impulse to implement utopia. WILLIAMS AND POLITICAL NORMATIVITY If Geuss ends up opening the door for utopian thinking to play some practical role, how wide should realists open that door? Bernard Williams suggests that we need not wholly exclude from politics the normative values that make utopias desirable; rather, our orientations should simply restrict the range of normative values we attend to in politics, disposing us to attend to a similarly restricted set of political visions. Once again, human rights exemplify the problem with utopian thinking; against the “unfortunate” profusion of rights enumerated in the UDHR ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 64), Williams argues that human rights should be sharply limited if they are to function appropriately in politics. However, this argument is as self-defeating as Geuss\'s. Williams pursues the third path open to Geuss and argues that utopian thinking leads to Politics as Application not because of the employment of normative value per se , but rather because utopia colonizes politics with nonpolitical values. However, I will argue that Williams\'s view also crucially relies on such nonpolitical values. This suggests that realists should abandon the view that Politics as Application is attributable to any methodological error in ambitious claim-making about normative desirability; there is no relation between the scope of a utopian vision and people\'s propensity to treat it as a blueprint for politics. Geuss cites Bernard Williams\'s realism as influencing his own ( Reference Geuss 2005 ; Reference Geuss 2014 ), so the similarity of their approaches should be unsurprising. Williams too identifies with Hobbes and writes, “I identify the ‘first’ political question in Hobbesian terms as the securing of order, protection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation. It is ‘first’ because solving it is the condition of solving, indeed posing, any others” ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 30). While Williams calls those outside the realist camp “political moralists” rather than “ethics-first” thinkers, their characteristic error once again concerns their conception of normativity and their number prominently includes Rawls, understood as the most important reproducer of Kant\'s erroneous “application” view ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 ). Where Williams parts ways with Geuss is in offering a particular conception of desirable order that has a realist normativity conceived as internal to politics rather than imported from a morality established apart from it. Williams locates that normativity in people\'s pervasive concern with legitimacy. Williams introduces what he calls the Basic Legitimation Demand (BLD), which “can be equated with there being an ‘acceptable’ solution to the first political question” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 4). The normative value of an order comes from this genuine acceptance by those subject to it and so we should accept great variation in views of what counts as a good reason to accept order. For example, according to Williams, inequality of status was quite compatible with legitimacy in medieval Europe, but conditions of modernity are such that people insist upon some form of equality as part of the BLD. Utopian thinking that sets higher aims for politics mistakes the values appropriate to a realm defined by power and disagreement. Williams combines this acknowledgement of local variation in what counts as acceptable with the belief that there are nonetheless limits to what counts as politics at all. Williams considers a caste society with a minority group “no better off than enemies of the state” and which has no reason to see the state as anything other than sheer coercive force ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 5). Williams notes, “there is nothing to be said to this group to explain why they shouldn\'t revolt” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 5, emphasis original) and so the BLD is clearly not met. Williams adds one further caveat: “the critical theory principle” calls for making sure that the structure of domination does not manipulate people into accepting the status quo ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 14). This principle makes the normativity of Williams\'s conception of order especially clear since it gives an observer a reason to think the BLD has not been met even when some of those subject to a state think otherwise. Williams\'s account thus helps us to see how a realist account could criticize orientations beyond offering an immanent critique of utopian aspirations. A useful orientation would facilitate practically coherent actions that contribute to order of the right kind—one freely accepted and legitimate according to the standards of those subject to it. An inconvenient orientation would fail to recognize that what counts as legitimate varies from place to place and time to time. For Williams, the refusal of universal applicability makes the normativity of his view internal to politics; where attempts to apply utopian thinking see politics as merely the venue for applying a priori values, Williams\'s realism sees politics as the context from which values arise. Despite this, Williams fails at differentiating his realist view of normativity from purportedly moralizing utopian views; human rights again help illustrate the problem. Williams writes, “the nearer political thought gets to action, as in the concrete affirmation of human rights, the more likely it is to be frivolous if it is utopian” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 25) and so, against the UDHR, Williams defends a core of human rights against torture, the denial of religious expression, and other wrongs he regards as “obvious” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 62). Such rights orient us to the boundary of politics since they mark when “the supposed solution [to the first political question], political power, [becomes] part of the problem” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 63) and therefore can never be accepted as legitimate. But in addressing two situations of apparent human rights violations that concern communities with diverging conceptions of legitimacy—women\'s rights and humanitarian intervention—Williams\'s argument relies on values from outside politics. These are not marginal cases to consider and they frequently press practical dilemmas on us; an orientation that disposes us to overlook them is fatally incomplete. Williams\'s claims may be more limited than the political moralists he targets, but as with Geuss, the difference between the views concerns the scope of their extrapolitical requirements, not a difference in their kind . Footnote 8 Consider the question of whether an egalitarian society should consider it a human rights violation when another country denies women the right to drive or vote. Williams writes, “the contemporary world is certainly within reach of the past, and the influences of the past include, now, theocratic conceptions of government and patriarchal ideas of the rights of women. Should we regard practices elsewhere that still express such conceptions as violations of fundamental human rights?” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 70) and answers no. He writes, “[t]he charge that a practice violates fundamental human rights is ultimate, the most serious of political accusations. In their most basic form, violations of human rights are very obvious, and so is what is wrong with them: unmediated coercion, might rather than right” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 72). Williams claims that the oppression of women is generally not a case of unmediated coercion because both men and women in theocratic and patriarchal societies are “jointly caught up in a set of beliefs which regulate their lives and are indeed unsound, but which are shared in ways that move the society further away from the paradigm of unjust coercion” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 27). Williams worries that labeling such cases human rights violations will lead to disastrous interventions as advocates force norms of gender equity on a society that doesn\'t widely accept them. Since it would be straightforwardly illegitimate to install a new government to protect my preferred a priori standards of human rights when its subjects did not accept them, Williams believes political realism leads to a principle of noninterference in such cases. As he describes it, his view “tells [people] about certain judgments which they need not make”—that is, we can safely overlook such possibilities because there are neither philosophical nor political reasons to act on them ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 68). Footnote 9 But there are a host of ways that someone who believes that women\'s rights are human rights could act because of that belief that avoid violating the BLD. Should egalitarians advocate for government policies that sanction such theocratic governments? Should they give money and support to indigenous feminist groups that are seeking to organize discontent and resistance? A realist orientation has no reason to direct attention away from these political possibilities. Williams has two options here: either his realism is indeterminate about cases where there are competing standards of legitimacy—which would undermine its claim to being an adequate source of orientation—or he must endorse noninterference on grounds he should regard as normatively “external” to politics. Williams opts for the latter and suggests that we ought not regard patriarchal oppression of women as one the “central core of evils” to which an international response is appropriate ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 74). This value judgment about the gravity of patriarchal oppression is not entailed by Williams\'s conception of politics, but rather is derived from normative and empirical considerations external to it—including a conservative view that counsels the preservation of existing conceptions of legitimacy until combating core evils requires some change in them. In trying to carve out a set of “obvious” human rights from the broader utopian program of achieving a world that respects the UDHR, Williams converges with critics like Moyn, who writes, “preventing catastrophe through minimalist ethical norms and building utopia through maximalist political vision. . .are absolutely different” and suggests that advocates “should restrict themselves to offering minimal constraints on responsible politics, not a new form of maximal politics of their own” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 226–7). But there is a cost to this effort to divorce human rights from utopianism: interpreting human rights as minimal constraints on politics implies that violations of those constraints are a form of domination located outside politics. Williams notes, “one lot of people terrorizing another lot of people is not a political situation” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 63); as a result, even when the atrocities are perpetrated by governments on minority groups, he characterizes the resultant suffering as a kind of moral wrong. As Williams himself notes, this way of characterizing the situation opens the door to justifications of humanitarian intervention as “an enlightened imperialism” since it identifies the minority group as suffering victims rather than political agents ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 151). In sum, to rule out both noncoercive efforts to shift standards of legitimacy (as in his judgment that the oppression of women should not understood as a human rights violation) and coercion in the name of nonpolitical suffering (if he wishes to block imperialism), Williams needs some additional normative premise to support noninterference. But any such premise would not be internal to politics as he has construed it. This problem is telling. In seeking to avoid the application of utopian visions to those that do not share them, these realists have consistently misunderstood the nature of their own position and its relation to utopian thinking—that is, they\'ve mistaken the politics of their own intervention. At bottom, their differences with opponents are not philosophical disagreements about the nature of value; in defending their preferred policies, both Geuss and Williams make use of the kind of values they claim to reject. Rather, their crucial difference from their opponents is a practical disagreement about what we can do to address contemporary political problems. Their constrained sense of how ideals can be used in politics prevents them from recognizing the realist grounds for valuing utopian thinking and, as a result, their realism needlessly cuts off consideration of some genuine political possibilities, inadvertently supporting the status quo despite their professedly liberatory intent. To see this, the next section considers alternative uses of human rights that show how utopian claims can avoid Politics as Application. REALIST HUMAN RIGHTS? A political theory cannot implement itself and the way a theory is applied may have effects contrary to what the theory establishes as ideal, as when human rights are used to legitimize state violence. Geuss and Williams are right that many practitioners of utopian thinking fail to account for this. But they are wrong to assume that application or motivation are the only practical uses of utopias; exploring the ways that some utopian uses of human rights can orient their adherents to present political possibilities can resolve the impasse that realists face when they claim to distinguish themselves based on a distinctive approach to normativity. None of this undercuts the realist argument that human rights claims can legitimize dangerous exercises of state power at home and abroad, in part because they are seen as outside politics—but it is essential to note that this perception is carefully cultivated by some advocates rather than intrinsic to the concept. As Moyn notes, “if those who invented the contemporary human rights culture were utopians, they were Machiavellians too, devising a strategy that would allow their brand of transformation to differ from the world as it was but also from alternative political agendas—often by strategically denying that their aims were strategic at all” ( Reference Moyn and Etinson 2014 , 25). Major human rights NGOs continue to strike this strategically apolitical pose despite the fact that it leads them to close alliances with human rights violators like the U.S. government. Footnote 10 The realists are right to point out that utopian thinking that positions itself as above politics can serve oppressive ends. Yet, as Williams\'s approach to humanitarian intervention showed, realists actually exacerbate that danger by locating rights violations outside politics. A better response on realist grounds is to emphasize the political status of human rights claims so that they can be seen as contestable articulations of particular demands. Indeed, many advocates make use of human rights in precisely this way; instead of expressing a longing to transcend politics, human rights claims are often better understood as political claims against prevailing views of legitimacy and the orientations that support them. To illustrate this possibility, I turn to two perhaps unlikely utopians: Michel Foucault and Malcolm X. Where the ideal theorist imagines a world in which everyone fully complies with the requirements of justice (Simmons Reference Simmons 2010 , 3–5), these thinkers of what might be called oppositional utopias envision desirable but impracticable responses to existing injustices; in particular, by using human rights to imagine an impossible unity of the powerless that momentarily erases their internal political differences, they produce an orientation to politics that perceives important possibilities that would otherwise be overlooked. It is important not to exaggerate the differences between ideal and oppositional utopias, however, since one can also engage in ideal theorizing that is appropriately oriented to real problems, as I argue in the next section. My point here is to show that avowedly utopian uses of human rights can contribute to an effective orientation to politics and so realists need not restrict them to a minimum core of claims or dismiss them entirely. While it may surprise to turn to him here, Foucault argued explicitly that utopias can draw our attention to political possibilities in our own world, avowing his interest in the “actually realized utopias in which. . .all the other real emplacements that can be found within the culture are, at the same time, represented, contested, and reversed” ( Reference Foucault and Faubion 1998 , 178). The kinds of utopias that interest Foucault are those that exist in some form within our world, but which also point beyond and contradict it. Two primary forms of utopia recur throughout his work: first, “the profoundly and originally utopian experience of the body” (Foucault Reference Foucault, Jones and Allais 2006 , 233); second, revolts and uprisings—what he describes as “the possibility of this moment where life cannot be exchanged, where power becomes powerless, and where, in front of the gallows and the machine guns, men rise up” (Afary and Anderson Reference Afary and Anderson 2005 , 264). I focus on the latter—ways of imagining the surprising reversal of power relations through collective action. We can see what makes this utopian in Foucault\'s sense by turning briefly to his reporting on the Iranian revolution. Asking Iranians what they wanted in 1978, Foucault reports their replies: “‘A utopia,’ some told me without any pejorative implication. ‘An ideal,’ most of them said to me. At any rate, it is something very old and also very far into the future” (Afary and Anderson Reference Afary and Anderson 2005 , 206). For Foucault, revolt is utopian because uprisings have always happened but also point beyond themselves to a world in which the collective sense of possibility and unity of that moment impossibly continues beyond the revolt itself. Of course, such utopian visions can themselves become oppressive when taken up by the powerful, as the actual Iranian revolution vividly illustrated, but to imagine otherwise would be to endorse precisely a blueprint for ending politics entirely. Such “unmasking” of utopia or human rights as dangerously enmeshed in power relations could never serve to discredit them entirely to Foucault, though, since he believes that no discourse takes place outside of power relations (Patton Reference Patton 2004 ). Nevertheless, this acknowledgement of the dangerous power of utopian thinking can help us to understand what Ben Golder aptly calls Foucault\'s “critical affirmation of rights discourse” (Golder Reference Golder 2011 , 286). Foucault sees human rights as utopian precisely because they are embedded in our politics, but also point beyond it and can contest it; indeed, he even sees a human rights framework as helping us to orient us to the possibility of a global revolt. Consider his 1981 remarks at a press conference to promote an effort to defend Vietnamese boat people (available in Keenan Reference Keenan 1987 , 20–1). Speaking on behalf of “a certain shared difficulty in accepting what is happening,” Foucault asserts the existence of “an international citizenry, which has its rights, which has its duties, and which promises to raise itself up against every abuse of power, no matter who the author or the victim.” Foucault here uses rights talk to an eminently political end without making any claims to a prepolitical or a priori foundation and without legitimizing state action. On the contrary, the rights of this international citizenry come precisely from a clear-eyed assessment of real political institutions, as he avows when he says, “People\'s misfortune must never be a silent remainder of politics. It founds an absolute right to rise up and to address those who hold power.” Unlike Williams\'s account of suffering as a moral wrong, Foucault avoids the trap of making those whose rights have been violated into victims in need of an enlightened imperial rescue. Instead, Foucault makes it clear that his own speech is political and interested, saying “After all, we are all governed and, to that extent, in solidarity.” Foucault\'s comments illustrate the potential for realist paths that Geuss and Williams miss. To speak of an international citizenry that takes direct action “against every abuse of power, no matter who the author or the victim” is a characteristic utopian hope insofar as it is both desirable and impracticable that everyone do what they ought to. But Foucault is not best understood as setting out a plan based on a priori principles or suggesting that we try to implement this utopian vision while ignoring possible political actions that are not on the path to its realization. Nor does Foucault\'s invocation of human rights constitute a repudiation of his earlier radical insights about power or a neoliberal turn that settles for the adequacy of traditional rights as a defense against domination, as some have argued (Paras Reference Paras 2006 ). Rather, Foucault asserts the rights of international citizenry as a response to the failure of institutions that ground their own legitimacy in a monopoly on rights protection. As Foucault explained in lectures given at the Collège de France in January 1976, his analysis typically aims “to understand power in its most regional forms and institutions, and especially at the points where this power transgresses the rules of right that organize and delineate it, oversteps those rules and is invested in institutions, is embodied in techniques and acquires the material means to intervene, sometimes in violent ways” ( Reference Foucault and Macey 2003 , 27–8). Geuss notably describes his own analysis of the way that rights talk reinforces some existing uses of power as Foucauldian ( Reference Geuss 2013 , 103), but unlike Geuss, Foucault maintains that the way institutions invariably overstep their own legitimizing rules also opens up possibilities for resistance. If relations of force can be naturalized and legitimized by the discourse of right, they can also be undone by turning rights talk against itself for liberatory ends; as he says in the context of gay rights, for example, “[r]ather than arguing that rights are fundamental and natural to the individual, we should try to imagine and create a new relational right that permits all possible types of relations to exist and not be prevented, blocked, or annulled by impoverished relational institutions” ( Reference Foucault and Rabinow 1997 , 158). Against Williams\'s and Moyn\'s suggestion that human rights be stripped of their utopian aspirations and Geuss\'s view that they be avoided entirely, Foucault suggests that imagining and claiming new rights can facilitate better political action. The impracticability of a global revolt to prevent human rights violations doesn\'t legitimate state intervention in its place; instead, this vision lends support to existing social movements assisting refugees while simultaneously drawing our attention to how a radically different world is required for people to genuinely enjoy their human rights. Such utopian thinking does not require us to detach ourselves from the world we actually live in, as Geuss feared, but instead takes seriously existing practices that can point to ideals beyond it. While, in the abstract, to claim a right may be a way of asserting something inviolable, in practice, weaker parties claiming or asserting rights against more powerful parties are doing something quite different. Rights demands can also be assertions, seizures, and even performances of the very rights being demanded (Ingram Reference Ingram 2013 ), as Malcolm X\'s use of human rights shows. Human rights were at the center of his political thinking following his departure from the Nation of Islam in 1964 and, prior to his assassination in 1965, he toured Africa and Europe for months to promote his plan to petition the United Nations to protest the U.S.’s violation of African-Americans’ human rights (Harris Reference Harris, Conyers and Smallwood 2008 ; Temkin Reference Temkin 2012 ). He explained the value of human rights as an orientation to politics when he claimed that “[t]he difference between the thinking and the scope of the Negroes who are involved in the human-rights struggle and those who are involved in the civil-rights struggle is that those so-called Negroes involved in the human-rights struggle don\'t look upon themselves as Americans. They look upon themselves as a part of dark mankind” ( Reference X and Breitman 1990 , 51–2; see also 34–6). In distinguishing human rights from civil rights, Malcolm X recognizes that some rights claims can play the pacifying and status-quo-preserving role that the realists identify. But far from asserting an a priori universality, he used human rights claims specifically to polarize and assert difference, constructing a new political identity by refusing identification with the state and drawing attention to its repressive power. Rather than assuming that everyone has the same relation to human rights, Malcolm X argues that African-Americans have a particular political aim in claiming them: to undermine state power by appealing beyond it, to “dark mankind.” He came to see human rights as the most effective political vehicle for an avowedly utopian Pan-Africanism, a desirable and impracticable form of unity among people of African descent throughout the world (Smith Reference Smith 1991 ). As with Foucault, the political efficacy of Malcolm X\'s vision does not depend on the possibility of realizing it. Regardless of whether “dark mankind” will ever exist as a unitary political force, the vision of it can nevertheless powerfully shape the self-understanding of political actors and facilitate new possibilities of action. In his view, civil rights advocates are ineffective because their identification with American citizenship has oriented them away from recognizing the way that white supremacy exercises power through institutions with which they identify; identification with “dark mankind” would better orient them to the operation of that power and to identify their own interests more readily. In his letter to the heads of state of the countries belonging to the Organization of African Unity, he likewise argues that a human rights framework would better orient them to the role of white supremacy in global politics and dispose them to an alliance with African-Americans: “You will never be fully respected until and unless we are also respected. . . . Our problem is your problem. It is not a Negro problem, nor an American problem. This is a world problem; a problem for humanity. It is not a problem of civil rights but a problem of human rights” ( Reference X and Breitman 1990 , 75). Where Geuss sees human rights as weakening social movements by orienting its adherents to individual victims, Malcolm X\'s act of claiming human rights is itself an assertion of collective political power and agency that makes it possible to track power and perceive political possibilities—in this case, for transnational solidarity—that might otherwise be overlooked. The realists acknowledge that we do not know the limits of what is possible in politics. Geuss says that offering responsible answers to political questions means “thinking about them in a space organized around possible alternatives to the present existing state of affairs” ( Reference Geuss 2005 , 39) and Williams affirms that “we should explore what more radical and ambitious forms of participatory or deliberative democracy are possible” ( Reference Williams and Hawthorn 2005 , 17). Yet exploring the space of possible alternatives requires utopian thinking that can help us to see new possibilities in the present, even if the worlds they describe are impracticable. Foucault\'s “international citizenry” may not literally rise against every abuse of power internationally, but his invocation of such a world illuminates opportunities for direct action; Malcolm X\'s use of human rights to orient African-Americans towards identifying with “dark mankind” rather than American citizenship similarly points political action down new paths for transnational solidarity. The end of the Cold War has only amplified the importance of nonstate actors in world politics and these oppositional utopias offer a model of how effective orientations to such a complex world might be imagined. Realism stands against the belief that we can have it all and, to combat that kind of wishful thinking, foregrounds the idea that a responsible politics entails accepting some loss. Moyn applies this thought to human rights and suggests that “in the long view, the search for rights beyond [the state] may have been at a considerable price: the loss of the inclusive space of membership that the concrete state, and even empire, had long provided in some form or other” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 42). I do not wish to contest Moyn\'s historical judgment, but to suggest that this nostalgia for the nation-state provides a poor model for orienting us effectively to whatever liberatory political possibilities there may be now. It is true that the UDHR does not provide a blueprint for addressing the economic inequality that concerns Moyn and Geuss, but as I have argued, the primary practical use of utopian thinking is not its application. Assuming otherwise leads Moyn to dismiss the use of human rights by Malcolm X and other African-American radicals as “a minor feature of a larger anticolonialism” (Moyn Reference Moyn 2010 , 106) because their plans were not put into action, but that mistakes their value. Their uses of human rights model the possibility of utopian thinking orienting people to political interests that more minimal views overlook. If one aims to orient people to a shared interest in opposing inequality in the global economy today, it is important to ask what better accomplishes this: utopian visions of a world where everyone enjoys periodic holidays with pay or Moyn\'s return to a national framework, which disposes adherents to see their interests in competition with other countries? As this suggests, a realist politics is not exempt from its own insight that every political choice entails a loss; for a politics that begins with the way existing institutions operate, it will always seem dubious for the powerless to oppose the plans of those in power. If realists want political theory to do its part in intervening to stop catastrophe, then they would do well to consider all the tools available to them. AN EFFECTIVELY UTOPIAN ORIENTATION? Foucault and Malcolm X illustrate how we can appreciate utopian thinking as a source of orientation to the present rather than as a blueprint for the future and so avoid the pervasive dissatisfactions that have characterized evaluations of utopia\'s political efficacy since the Cold War. In closing, I want to consider an alternative way of practicing political theory in light of these oppositional utopians as well as the realist critique of applying utopian thinking. Where ideal theory as blueprint fixes the future and then proclaims that we should march towards a predetermined destination, a view of ideal theory as orientation suggests that a utopia isn\'t worth pursuing if it can\'t orient us to the here and now. I develop this view by considering John Rawls, whom the realists identify as their leading contemporary opponent. While realists correctly note that Rawls\'s view lacks an adequate conception of power, they overlook the fact that Rawls specifically asserted that “[n]either political philosophy nor justice as fairness. . .is applied moral philosophy” ( Reference Rawls and Kelly 2001a , 14). Attending to this surprising strand in Rawls\'s work not only reverses a common interpretation of his thought (as suggested by the fact that Simmons and Pogge take themselves to be following Rawls), but also provides a useful framework for extending the force of utopian thinking in political theory today. In a 1983 lecture, Rawls said, “Williams is right that there can be no ethical theory as he describes it, that is, a philosophical structure which together with some degree of empirical fact, yields a decision procedure for moral reasoning. . .Perhaps, though, while it cannot provide a decision procedure, it can provide something else” (Forrester Reference Forrester 2012 , 264). What can it provide? In Justice as Fairness: A Restatement , Rawls strikingly calls orientation one of the primary aims of political philosophy. He writes, “the members of any civilized society need a conception that enables them to understand themselves as members having a certain political status—in a democracy, that of equal citizenship—and how this status affects their relation to their social world. This need political philosophy may try to answer, and this role I call that of orientation” ( Reference Rawls and Kelly 2001a , 2–3). Like the realists, Rawls\'s account of orientation is contextual rather than a priori and he endorses the idea that facilitating action requires knowledge of one\'s social world and the way that legitimating ideas shape political statuses in that world. Footnote 11 Rawls emphasizes orientation as a response to a particular practical obstacle to political action; in a modern social world characterized by complex systems of interdependence, it is impossible for most people to understand fully how their actions contribute to their society and in turn rely on the contributions of others. In order to be appropriately responsive to others in this context, individuals need to understand themselves as playing a particular role. But equal citizenship is only one orienting role. One of the tasks of utopian thinking today is to propose more such roles to guide political action that involves those who are not officially co-citizens, as Foucault and Malcolm X attempted with their respective invocations of “international citizenry” and “dark mankind.” Of course, even people in actually existing democracies do not enjoy genuinely equal citizenship. How then could Rawls\'s utopian invocation of genuinely equal citizenship orient us effectively to an unjust present? Geuss and Williams acknowledge that society is always a mixture of cooperation and conflict, but take it as a given that a responsible orientation must direct political actors to attend to the pervasiveness of conflict and thus the fragility of order. Rawls proposes an alternative orientation to these same facts. The most effective means of managing conflict may not be to insist on its centrality or inevitability. According to Rawls, we are much more likely to maintain a social order when we orient ourselves to other members of society as individuals with equal status with whom we share some interests (e.g., maintaining order) even as we conflict in other areas. His view is that we may avoid repeating our violent history if we habitually attend to the benefits from being in society and interpret society as a cooperative project with others as equal partners. This doesn\'t mean Rawls is so naïve as to think that all Americans currently enjoy truly equal political status ( Reference Rawls and Kelly 2001a , 136–40). Neither does such a suggestion presuppose an end to conflict (Rawls Reference Rawls 1996 , xviii–xix and 54–8). Instead we might interpret Rawls along the lines suggested by Williams\'s distinction between politics and domination (Jubb Reference Jubb 2015 ); attending to the way that political disagreements presuppose the renunciation of domination may make such disagreements more amenable to resolution. By orienting ourselves to those institutions and practices where values are partially and imperfectly instantiated in the world, we are better able to act in ways that promote the fuller realization of those values. For Rawls as for the realists, a political theory fails when it tends to produce actions with effects that are contrary to the values that the theory promotes. In that sense, the normativity is immanent to the orientation rather than directing it from outside. If being oriented by Rawls\'s utopian vision does not dispose its adherents to actions that promote equality in our society, then it will have failed by its own lights. And Rawls\'s vision should be faulted on these terms. While the realists misunderstand the nature of their dispute with Rawls, they are right that he fails to develop a language to talk about power that would make it possible to orient one\'s actions to it (PRP, 90). Rawls\'s own ideal theory avoids offering an a priori interpretation of institutions as Kant does, but is nevertheless left profoundly one-sided; it provides a way to see the value in existing institutions without a means to analyze their problems. But attending to power can change our fundamental interpretation of existing institutions. As Malcolm X suggested, deciding whether or not American institutions even partially instantiate the value of equality rather than using it as ideological cover for white supremacy requires judgments about both empirical and normative matters. Through the idea of ideal theory as orientation, Rawls illuminates what effective utopian thinking can be today, though his own theory falls regrettably short. If the search for replacement utopias that began 25 years ago is ever to come to an end, it will not be because the right blueprints are finally discovered nor because people decide to put aside their utopian hopes entirely. To end this prolonged impasse in which utopia seems both necessary and impossible, we need to change what we are searching for. Geuss and Williams show us that political theory should not offer a plan, but an orientation; however, they unduly constrain the politics of their intervention by suggesting that utopia has no appropriate role to play as a source of orientation. I have argued that utopian thinking can and should aim at developing orientations that both facilitate a realistic power analysis of existing institutions and attend to the utopian paths made possible by those institutions’ partial and deeply imperfect instantiations of values like equality, freedom, and human rights. If political thinking and political action are to be productively linked, both realism and utopia are essential today."}, {\'title\': \'What Makes a Utopia Inconvenient?

Although New Harmony was propagandized as a symbol for equality of the sexes, its women had different opinions on what the community actually offered to them. Some women found new freedoms but most of them experienced increased demands on their timeworn domestic services. Some women, especially those from working-class backgrounds, felt that their situation was bettered by the move, however, the majority of the women often felt betrayed by false promises of equality that brought them mostly demeaning labor. It was difficult to meet the wants and expectations of so many different people. I think the take home from this failure of unification in the society directly parallels all of the other utopian societies we have read about . Utopian thinkers wanted to be able to create a society in which all races, classes and genders came together and lived harmoniously. Unfortunately, as we have seen all too often during our class research, bringing all of these different people together, with completely different backgrounds, initiated the breakdown of the society. One connection I could make between Robert Owen’s New Harmony and Thomas More’s Utopia , although fairly unrelated to topic of unity above, is how the traditional view of gender roles seemed to permeate the thinking of these male utopian leaders. Thomas More referred to women, bluntly, as “the weaker sex” (More 60), and gave them more simple jobs that required less strength, such as weaving, while the men passed their time with carpentry or metal work. Although a minor example, Thomas More degraded women by providing them with smaller tasks, although most of the women were just as able to perform the tasks that men did. Although they claimed to be forward thinking and driven by peace and equality, many utopian thinkers did not consider the lives of women to be as important as the lives of men. Work Cited: More, T.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

Examples of utopian societies can be found in literature, such as Plato\'s Republic, and in real-world communities, such as the hippie communes of the 1960s.

In a utopian society, the goal is to create a system where everyone has access to the resources they need to survive and thrive, and where the government serves the needs of the working class. Utopian thinking can be used to address specific business problems and can help executives develop a vision for a better world.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    -

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    -

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    -

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

Examples of utopian societies can be found in literature, such as Plato\'s Republic, and in real-world communities, such as the hippie communes of the 1960s.

In a utopian society, the goal is to create a system where everyone has access to the resources they need to survive and thrive, and where the government serves the needs of the working class. Utopian thinking can be used to address specific business problems and can help executives develop a vision for a better world. It allows people to think about what they want to achieve and how they can work together to create a more equitable and just society.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

Examples of utopian societies can be found in literature, such as Plato\'s Republic, and in real-world communities, such as the hippie communes of the 1960s.

In a utopian society, the goal is to create a system where everyone has access to the resources they need to survive and thrive, and where the government serves the needs of the working class.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "final_answer": {\n      "description": "The final answer based on your cognition",\n      "title": "Final Answer",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "final_answer"\n  ],\n  "title": "FinalAnswer",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

Examples of utopian societies can be found in literature, such as Plato\'s Republic, and in real-world communities, such as the hippie communes of the 1960s.

In a utopian society, the goal is to create a system where everyone has access to the resources they need to survive and thrive, and where the government serves the needs of the working class. Utopian thinking can be used to address specific business problems and can help executives develop a vision for a better world.

Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     "graph": [\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q",\n         "sub_question": "How has telework affected work-life boundaries?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts."\n       },\n       {\n         "parent_question_id": "Q.1",\n         "sub_question": "Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?",\n         "edge_annotation": "Social impact includes distributional effects across groups."\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "nodes": [\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.1",\n          "new_annotation": "Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress."\n        },\n        {\n          "question_id": "Q.2",\n          "new_annotation": "Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality."\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      "reason": "The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "critical_evaluation": {\n      "description": "Your reflection after gathering information",\n      "title": "Critical Evaluation",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "critical_evaluation"\n  ],\n  "title": "CriticalEvaluation",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "tool_name": {\n      "description": "The name of the tool to call",\n      "title": "Tool Name",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "tool_parameters": {\n      "description": "JSON string of tool parameters",\n      "title": "Tool Parameters",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "tool_name",\n    "tool_parameters"\n  ],\n  "title": "ToolCall",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n\n\n\n        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide\n        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:\n\n\n        {\n  "properties": {\n    "final_answer": {\n      "description": "The final answer based on your cognition",\n      "title": "Final Answer",\n      "type": "string"\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "final_answer"\n  ],\n  "title": "FinalAnswer",\n  "type": "object"\n}\n\n        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    }\n  ],\n  "edges": []\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:question_decompose\nTool\'s parameters:{"graph": [{"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?", "edge_annotation": "Understanding utopianism\'s core principles is essential to evaluating its pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "How have utopian societies been implemented historically?", "edge_annotation": "Examining past attempts at utopian societies can provide insight into potential pros and cons."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential benefits of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the advantages can help balance the evaluation of utopianism."}, {"parent_question_id": "Q", "sub_question": "What are the potential drawbacks of a utopian society?", "edge_annotation": "Considering the disadvantages is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of utopianism\'s pros and cons."}]}'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\n  "nodes": [\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q",\n      "question": "pros and cons of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": ""\n    },\n    {\n      "node_id": "Q.1",\n      "question": "What are the key principles of utopianism?",\n      "annotation": "The key principles of utopianism involve the creation of an idealized society that is envisioned as perfect, where the term \'utopia\' denotes a nonexistent but imagined ideal society.

2025-04-15 02:16:39,165 [INFO] LLM Response:
Utopianism is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses a wide range of principles and ideals aimed at creating an idealized society. At its core, utopianism is guided by principles such as criticism, change, and compensation, which serve as a foundation for guiding societal participation toward the realization of an envisioned ideal society. These principles motivate collective efforts and introduce a pathway for participation without requiring specific group affiliation.

Historical examples of utopian societies, such as Brook Farm and the Tolstoy Farm, provide valuable insights into both the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing utopian ideals. These examples highlight the challenges of reconciling diverse individual wants and expectations within a utopian framework, as well as the tendency for such societies to break down due to differences in background and views among their members.

The potential benefits of a utopian society are rooted in principles of social democracy, emphasizing economic justice, democratic participation, and equality under the law. These benefits include comprehensive access to healthcare, education, and a clean environment, as well as guaranteed basic income, freedom of expression, equal opportunities, peaceful coexistence, and shared responsibility. However, the potential drawbacks of a utopian society include the difficulty in meeting the diverse wants and expectations of its members and the historical tendency for such societies to fail due to differences among members.

In conclusion, utopianism presents a complex array of pros and cons, reflecting both the ideals of creating a perfect society and the challenges inherent in achieving such a vision. By understanding the core principles, historical implementations, potential benefits, and drawbacks of utopianism, we can gain a nuanced appreciation for the complexities and trade-offs involved in pursuing utopian ideals.
