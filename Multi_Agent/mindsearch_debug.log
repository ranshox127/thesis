Do not introduce new parent questions that have not appeared before.\n   - Each decomposition must map a `parent_q` to a list of `sub_questions`.\n   - You must provide a global `reason` explaining **why** decomposition is needed.\n   - Format:\n     ```json\n     {\n       "reason": "These questions require finer-grained analysis.",\n       "mapping": [\n         {\n           "parent_q": "How does climate change affect agriculture?",\n           "sub_questions": [\n             "How does temperature rise affect crop yield?",\n             "How does drought impact livestock?"\n           ]\n         },\n         {\n           "parent_q": "What are the social impacts of climate change?",\n           "sub_questions": [\n             "How does climate change affect migration patterns?",\n             "What mental health issues are linked to climate change?"\n           ]\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **final_answer**\n   - Use this only when you believe the question can be directly answered, either based on prior knowledge or based on the `<sub-answers>` returned by previous decompositions.\n   - Provide a `reason` explaining **why** a final answer can now be given.\n   - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n\n---\n\n## Observation Rules\n\n- You may receive a block like:\n  ```\n  <sub-answers>\n  [ ... structured list of sub-questions and their summarized answers ... ]\n  </sub-answers>\n  ```\n  This means earlier decomposed questions have been resolved. You should:\n  - Consider whether these provide enough context to synthesize a final answer.\n  - Or decide whether **further decomposition** is needed for any sub-question.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning Format\n\nFor every action:\n1. First, **explain your reasoning** clearly in natural language.\n2. Then, **invoke one of the tools** using structured output (function call).\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Decomposing Questions\n\n\'\'\'\nThe original question is too broad, spanning environmental, economic, and social dimensions. I will decompose it into manageable parts for better analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  "reason": "The question requires analysis across multiple domains.",\n  "mapping": [\n    {\n      "parent_q": "How can we reduce global carbon emissions?",\n      "sub_questions": [\n        "What are the biggest sources of carbon emissions?",\n        "What policies have proven effective in reducing emissions?",\n        "What role does individual behavior play in emission reduction?"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\'\'\'\n\n### Providing a Final Answer\n\n\'\'\'\nI have received sufficient sub-answers, and they together form a complete picture. I can now provide a final answer to the original question.\n\n```json\n{\n  "reason": "The provided sub-answers cover all aspects of the original question.",\n}\n```\n\'\'\''}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: what leads to racism?'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'tool_choice': 'required', 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'question_decompose', 'description': 'Decompose one or more complex questions into sub-questions with reasoning.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Why the decomposition is needed'}, 'mapping': {'type': 'array', 'description': 'List of parent questions and their sub-questions', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'parent_q': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The original question being broken down'}, 'sub_questions': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of sub-questions derived from the parent question'}}, 'required': ['parent_q', 'sub_questions'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['reason', 'mapping'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'final_answer', 'description': 'Based on the current information and your confidence, explain why a final answer can be generated.', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Explain why you now have enough information to provide a final answer.'}}, 'required': ['reason'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}]}}

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”'}, {'title': 'How historical racism influences modern poverty and racial inequality', 'url': 'https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/Penn-sociology-research-historical-racism-modern-poverty-racial-inequality', 'content': 'The practice of art collection as a collaboration As part of an undergraduate course, Penn faculty and students curated an Arthur Ross Gallery exhibition of works from the Neumann family’s extensive collection of modern and contemporary art.'}]"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

This module describes a systemic approach to understanding racism and the implications of such an approach in psychology. Systemic approaches emphasize the important roles historical, cultural, legal, political, and economic systems have in reproducing contemporary forms of racism. By engaging this module, students will be able to better understand the implications of a systemic (versus individualistic) approach in psychology for anti-racist research, anti-racist practices, and anti-racist interventions. Distinguish individual and systemic approaches to racism in psychology Understand race as a social construction and its historical and contemporary links to racism Learn about psychological mechanisms related to differences in perceptions of racism Understand the implications of a systemic approach to racism for research and intervention efforts Consider important connections between overlapping identities and oppression Introduction In 2020, Kennedy Mitchum–a recent college graduate–wrote a series of emails to the editors at Merriam-Webster dictionary, asking them to update their online definitions of racism. At the time, the definition–which had not been significantly revised in decades–contained three entries: Racism is “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences reflect an inherent superiority of a particular race” (or, in other words: racial bigotry) Racism is “a doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles”. (Racism as “doctrine” highlights racism as a set of beliefs held by different political systems like Apartheid or groups like White Supremacists) Racism is “racial prejudice or discrimination.” These definitions might be similar to the ways in which you think about racism. Indeed, these definitions are widely used and they frame everyday discussions of the topic. Thinking about racism as a problem among a certain set of biased or prejudiced people can lead us to underestimate the problem of racism. This is because it narrows the focus to individual acts motivated by hate or ignorance and it overlooks more systemic biases. In this module, we will discuss racism as a multifaceted and multi-level concept. Different Understandings of Racism VIDEO In her email to the dictionary editors, Mitchum wrote, “Racism is not only prejudice against a certain race due to the color of a person’s skin, as it states in your dictionary. It is both prejudice combined with social and institutional power. It is a system of advantage based on skin color” (Hauser, 2020). Spurred by the exchange with Mitchum and the Black Lives Matter Protests in the summer of 2020, the editors updated their definition of racism which now has two entries. The first entry maintains the definition of racism as individual beliefs but the second now explicitly emphasizes racism as systemic oppression. This change is consistent with scholarship that defines racism as a system of advantage and disadvantage based on social, historical, and cultural constructions of race and ethnicity (Jones, 1997/1998; Tatum, 1997; Wellman, 1993). Though this view is generally accepted by psychologists now, it has not always been the case. In psychology, the term racism has sometimes been used synonymously with prejudice (biased feelings or affect), stereotyping (biased thoughts and beliefs, or flawed generalizations), discrimination (differential or the absence of equal treatment), and bigotry (intolerance or hatred toward those with differing beliefs) (Adams et al., 2008a; Adams et al., 2008b). This approach reduces racism to its most basic parts at the individual level so that it can more easily be studied in a laboratory. However, it risks minimizing the institutional, systemic, and cultural processes that inform racism. Research suggests that different understandings of racism—as a problem of individual bias versus a structurally embedded force—are not randomly distributed across people. In the United States, understanding of racism as individual bias is especially pronounced among White Americans (Blauner, 2019; Carter & Murphy, 2015; Sommers & Norton, 2006). For example, Figure 1 (left side) shows the results of polls (Pew Research Center, 2016) that generally find that White Americans are far more likely than Black Americans to define the problem of racism narrowly as discrimination “based on the prejudice of individuals.” Conversely, Black Americans are more likely than White Americans to define the problem of racism more broadly as discrimination “built into laws and institutions.” Beyond differences in the definition of racism, researchers have also noted group differences in perceptions of the role that racism plays in the modern world. Consider the results of another survey that also appear in Figure 1 (right side). Across several social issues, the percentage of participants who believe that racism impacts a wide range of social problems is much lower among White American than among Black American respondents. Figure 1. [Image: Pew Research Center, tinyurl.com/2twte78j, All Rights Reserved.] Systemic Racism VIDEO Systemic approaches to racism emphasize the particular roles that different societal factors—historical, cultural, legal, political, and economic—have played in organizing who is at the top or bottom of a society’s racial hierarchy (Salter et al., 2018) There are a few key ideas that are important to keep in mind for understanding racism as systemic. First, ‘race’ itself, is a social construct . Racial categories are arbitrary in that there is not substantial scientific evidence supporting a clear biological division of ‘races.’ Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why there are four or five common categories, but not 3, 29, or 101? Even though we treat racial categories as if they are true biological distinctions, they are not. Human beings share 99.9% of their genetic makeup (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2018). Most people have physical characteristics or phenotypes that could be associated with more than one racial group. In fact, there are no traits that are only present in one population or ‘race’. There are many expressions of traits found within and across different racial groups (see the images in Figure 2, for example). To say that race is an arbitrary social construct does not mean, however, that peoples’ race-based experiences are not real. Figure 2. [Images in clockwise order: Graham Crumb, https://tinyurl.com/7nwd3pvy, CC BY SA 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/4npnmepz; Ian Beatty, https://tinyurl.com/yc65txse, CC BY SA 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/4npnmepz; Erik Jacobs, https://tinyurl.com/2p8n47hh, CC BY 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/39uaces5; Abolfazl Eslami, https://tinyurl.com/5n6k4ftj, https://tinyurl.com/mrb5u7zv] Second, racial categories were developed with intentions that have fluctuated over time. Racial categorizations have played a key role in dictating which people are marginalized . For example, upon their arrival in the British colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish Catholic immigrants were initially racialized as non-White, working and living alongside free and enslaved Black people (Ignatiev, 2012; Garner, 2007). As Celts, the Irish were considered a less-developed, uncivilized race relative to Anglo-Saxons and faced wide-spread discrimination in this context. However, with a rising population of enslaved Africans and a need to easily distinguish enslaved from free laborers, it became useful to expand the definition of whiteness (Garner, 2007). In the United States, actively defining and redefining who could be considered racially ‘White’ (and free) fortified the racial hierarchy and ultimately cemented enslaved status as tied to Blackness. Modern ideas about race, in the Western world, have their foundations in histories of European imperialism and colonialism. European settlers came into (often violent) contact with communities that they deemed different in appearance and customs. Missionaries, slavers, and explorers commonly described darker-skinned “others” as uncivilized, barbaric, and otherwise culturally deficient in comparison to their European compatriots. The oppression of darker-skinned groups was often based on the assumed superiority of European language, intelligence, morality, beauty, and culture. Competitive pursuit of wealth among European nations accelerated the exploitation, enslavement, and genocide of non-European peoples across the globe (Guthrie, 2004). This process of deeming one’s own group as superior and another group as inferior to motivate and justify violence and colonization is not unique to European contexts, but its duration, extent, and lasting implications make it one of the most staggering examples. Third, there are instances where the historical legacy of racism continues to bear racist consequences today. Even when laws may have changed, traces of historical racism still remain. For example, the patterns of racially segregated housing in most major US cities that we see today map onto governmental policies that emerged in the 1910s and 20s to restrict where African Americans could live and buy homes (Rothstein, 2017). In South Africa, Apartheid (1940s-1990s) systematically denied non-White people access to most forms of capital, guaranteeing that South Africa would be controlled politically, socially, and economically by the nation’s minority White population. Despite the repeal of Apartheid laws and subsequent democratic elections, South African society still struggles with race-based inequalities in wealth, education, and health (National Research Council Panel on Race, Ethnicity, and Health in Later Life, 2004; WIDER & Oosthuizen, 2019). Bridging the Divide: Psychological Research on Perceiving and Denying Racism We have noted that people see racism in different lights. How should we understand such differences in perception of racism? Which psychological factors predict perceptions or denial of racism? Before we discuss a few key factors, we want to point out a tendency of people to focus explanations on groups we think do not fit a perceived norm (Hegarty & Pratto, 2001). Take for example, the caption of Figure 3 from a Pew Research Center report (2020) on views of racial progress in the United States. The caption, “Growing share of Black and Hispanic adults say the country hasn’t made enough progress on racial equality” follows a common tendency to explain differences in views as if it is the minoritized group that deviates from an unspoken norm. Yes, when you examine the data, there are increases between 2019 and 2020 in the number of Black and Hispanic adults who say the United States has not gone far enough in giving equal rights to Black Americans. However, the data show that the graph could also be titled, ‘White views that America’s racial progress has been just about right, remain stagnant’. This tendency to locate the source of group differences in racial “otherness” is, itself, a manifestation of racism of a sort that Thomas Teo (2010) has referred to as epistemological violence . Figure 3. [Image: Pew Research Center, tinyurl.com/4w9sxuwv, All Rights Reserved.] To avoid this, social psychologists suggest that we “turn the analytic lens” (Adams & Salter, 2007) and consider the flip side of the same coin. In this case, we should consider the topic from the standpoint of marginalized groups. The statistic that requires further explanation is the widespread belief that U.S. society has already done enough to attain racial equality. Claims about equality are not consistent with statistical evidence, which documents racial inequalities in education, employment, health, and income (e.g., American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Educational Disparities, 2012; U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). Instead, beliefs about racial equality reflect psychological processes that can facilitate underreporting of the extent of racism in US society. So, what are those psychological processes? Research has revealed two mechanisms through which under-reporting and denial of systemic racism tend to occur. The first—called “defensive motivations” — focuses on how acknowledging racism or other forms of oppression can pose a threat to one’s identity or worldview. The second—known as “foundations of knowledge”—focuses on the cultural information that forms people’s judgments. Defensive Motivations For an advantaged person to admit that racism is prominent in one’s society, they must acknowledge that, ultimately, they receive advantages from an illegitimate system (Jost, Banaji & Nosek, 2004; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). This acknowledgment can threaten one’s sense of personal self-worth or the worth of the group to which the person belongs, known as collective self-worth (O’Brien & Major, 2005). When one’s group is implicated by historical or contemporary wrong-doing, members of that group are motivated to deny that wrong-doing is ongoing, significant, or pervasive in order to maintain a positive view of one’s social group (e.g., Branscombe et al., 1999). For example, when researchers boosted White research participants’ sense of self-worth with positive self-statements, they were then more likely to perceive systemic racism than did participants in a control condition (Unzueta & Lowery, 2008; Adams, Tormala, & O’Brien, 2006). Outside of the U.S. context, researchers have also found that, after completing a self-affirmation task, Israeli participants were more willing to acknowledge the victimization of Palestinians and the Israeli participation in that victimization (Čehajić-Clancy et al., 2011). Opposition to acknowledging the extent to which racism operates in society can sometimes take the form of neutral claims on racism-relevant issues. For example, color-blind race ideology —the idea that people “do not see race”—can seem enlightened but, in practice, primarily serves the purpose of not “seeing” racism. Color-blind racial frames downplay the significance of ethnic and racial identity in peoples’ lived experiences and ignore the role of systemic oppression in impacting opportunities (e.g., Neville et al., 2013 ). Augoustinos and colleagues (2005) found that White Australians often used this principle to justify their opposition to anti-racism initiatives that would benefit Aboriginal people ( Augoustinos, Tuffin, & Every, 2005 ; see also Tuffin, 2008 ). Notably, they would dismiss the need for race-conscious policies that would address historical discrimination by suggesting that all people should be treated equally (and so Aboriginal people should not be given something “extra”), that people should be treated as individuals (and so Aboriginal people should not be treated as a group), and that White people have advanced through merit (thereby ignoring historically accumulated advantages). Foundations of Knowledge Beyond defensive motivations, there is another category of explanations for the tendency to minimize or deny racism. This category concerns the cultural knowledge that informs people’s judgments. A person’s cultural frame might lead to various conclusions about racism. Imagine, for example, an officer deciding to detain a person at the U.S.-Mexico border. Using a “racism as individual prejudice” framework, one might look toward features of the officer (i.e., how they feel about Mexicans) and conclude that without evidence of personal racial bias, the detention was simply the case of an officer applying the law in race-neutral fashion. In contrast, using a more systemic definition of racism, one might see the resulting detention as racially biased, regardless of the personal inclinations of an individual officer, because of the unequal and disparate impact of the policy itself. Consistent with this, researchers have found endorsements for harsher treatment of undocumented Mexican immigrants than undocumented Canadian immigrants, especially among White participants who equated being a true American with ethnocentric cultural values (e.g., being able to speak English without a “foreign” accent) (Mukherjee et al., 2013). Discretionary institutional policies that rely on ethno-racial profiling and mistreatment are forms of structural racism and everyday violence (Alexander, 2011). Another kind of cultural knowledge that facilitates or inhibits awareness of racism is collective memory about the role of past racism. Research on the Marley Hypothesis reveals that perceptions of racism are positively related to accurate historical knowledge (Bonam et al., 2019; Nelson, Adams, & Salter, 2013). In these studies, Black and White participants completed a “Black history” quiz that asked about historical events such as the U.S. government deliberately exposing black members of the military to syphilis, or hiding microphones in the hotel rooms of Civil Rights leaders. In the original study (Nelson et al., 2013) and in the replication (Bonam et al., 2019), White Americans scored lower on the measure of historical accuracy than did the Black Americans. Moreover, differences in knowledge of past racism helped explain Black and White differences in perception of present racism in U.S. society. Kurtiş and colleagues (2017) applied a similar research approach in Turkish contexts to further understand the relationship between critical historical knowledge about minority populations and policy support. They found that participants who demonstrated more accurate knowledge about officially silenced incidents of historical violence regarding minorities expressed greater support for protection of minority rights (Kurtiş, Soylu-Yalçınkaya, & Adams, 2017). Collective memory about racism is not only an individual-level phenomenon. What we know about historical events is embodied in cultural tools like textbooks, school curricula, government-sanctioned holidays, and memorials. Official government accounts of history tend to sanitize or silence the more negative or racist stories in order to maintain a positive view of a country’s past and present. For example, Moore (2020) analyzed Australian history textbooks from 1950-2010. She was interested in the idea of interest-convergence . Interest convergence suggests that White (or dominant group) engagement in racial progress emerges when it aligns with their own interests. Moore (2020) discovered that earlier textbooks were ‘loud and proud’ when highlighting supposed deficiencies in Aboriginal people and White exceptionalism. However, over time they were reframed in more subtle terms. For example, early Aboriginal sea voyages are sometimes dismissed as short, easy, and as employing primitive boats. Similarly, descriptions of hunting and gathering are framed to suggest that Aboriginal communities operated by survival instinct rather than making sophisticated, intentional, and cooperative community decisions. These explanations of Aboriginal culture are less overtly racist, but continue to set up the idea that White settlers in Australia brought more sophisticated technology, the rule of law, and other forms of “civilization.” Moore (2020) suggests that changes from overtly racist textbook narratives to more subtle forms are designed to affirm White racial progressiveness while still upholding White Supremacy. Consistent with these findings, research on how high schools in the U.S. discuss Black history revealed differences between predominantly Black and predominantly White schools (Salter & Adams, 2016). The researchers observed that predominantly White schools were more likely to present a version of Black history that promotes multicultural tolerance and diversity. Another notable strategy was to highlight individual Black American achievement—inventors, intellectuals, and Civil Rights heroes—while minimizing discussion of the historical barriers that these people faced. By contrast, predominantly Black schools were more likely to position Black history as accounts of the ongoing legacy of systemic exploitation and violent oppression. Cultural products, such as school curricula and textbooks, are not necessarily neutral accounts of what factually happened in the past; they reflect biases carried forward from the past and biases cultivated in the present. Psychological studies have also highlighted the consequences of being exposed to different foundations of knowledge. In the same line of research described above, Salter and Adams (2016) randomly assigned White American university students to view two distinct representations of Black History Month: those from predominantly White schools or those from predominantly Black schools. Their results indicate that exposure to representations of history from predominantly Black schools (which were more likely to contain narratives of historical racism) led to greater perceptions of racism and support for antiracist policies. Similarly, in a study by Bonam and colleagues (2019), White American participants listened to a clip of historian Richard Rothstein on NPR’s Fresh Air program discussing the federal government’s role in creating Black ghettos and the ongoing legacy of systemic racism in housing. The researchers found that listening to the clip increased critical history knowledge (in comparison to a control condition), increased beliefs about the government’s active role in creating Black ghettos, and, in turn, increased perceptions of systemic racism. Together, studies in this research program suggest how cultural representations of the past—what we might refer to as collective memory—matter for interpretation of the present. These studies also illuminate different sources of knowledge as important components for perceiving systemic racism. People who engage with representations of history that obscure past racism not only indicate a smaller role for racism as an explanation for contemporary events, but also express less support for reparative policies such as affirmative action than do people who engage with representations that acknowledge past racism. Before we move to the final section of the module, we would like you to pause and consider the links between the two mechanisms described in this section: motivation to view one’s self positively and information-based judgments of racism. Though we have presented them separately, they are related to each other. For example, Mukherjee and colleagues (2017) asked participants in India to rate historical events that either glorified India or acknowledged wrongdoing against marginalized groups. The nation-glorifying events were rated as more relevant and more important for the study of Indian history. Notably, exposure to glorifying themes about collective achievements in India produced higher national identification and exposure to critical narratives about collective wrongdoing decreased national identification. Thus, the two processes affect one another: certain information boosted the desire to view one’s group favorably and viewing one’s group favorably predicted the types of information a person prefers. Important to our discussion, exposure to critical narratives produced greater perceptions of injustice in India. By contrast, exposure to themes that glorified India lowered perceptions of injustice. Regardless of individual beliefs and biases, mainstream cultural tools influence people to approach the topic of racial justice in ways that serve national and dominant group interests. Implications for Action against Racism A major goal of this module has been to articulate a systemic approach to understanding racism. We end the module by discussing the implications of this approach for action against racism. We break our discussion into three distinct sections: 1) anti-racist research, 2) anti-racist practices and interventions, and 3) intersectional considerations. Anti-Racist Research As discussed above, standard psychological accounts of racism often suggest that it is a problem of biased individuals. This individualistic approach to racism is evident in research on the topic. Racism research often examines individual personality traits such as authoritarian personality or social justice orientation (see Noba’s Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping ). This approach to understanding racism leads to the idea that counteracting racism consists of measuring and altering personal qualities such as prejudice. As an example, one trend has involved the development of measures to identify people with implicit racist dispositions (e.g., Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). Another research trend has been to develop strategies that people might use to change their racist dispositions (Devine, Brodish, & Vance, 2005; Monteith, Ashburn-Nardo, Voils, & Czopp, 2002; Sassenberg & Moskowitz, 2005). Although research on individual factors in racism can reveal important insights, it may miss others. In contrast to an exclusive focus on individual dispositions, a systemic approach locates the roots of racism in social and cultural factors. This approach calls for research to examine the role that institutions, norms, laws, and policies play in racism. Table 1 lists examples of both individual and systemic questions about racism that researchers might ask. The systemic questions emphasize an attention to the interplay between individual and systemic oppression (see Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbett, 1998; Oakes, Haslam, & Turner, 1994). Addressing these questions requires the use of unique theoretical perspectives and empirical techniques that are relatively rare in psychological research (e.g., discourse analysis, decolonial approaches, critical race theory frameworks). These approaches have the potential to yield new insights because they are more likely to include the experiences and perspectives of racially marginalized people. Table 1. Anti-Racist Intervention Beyond its implications for research, a systemic approach to racism also suggests a shift in the emphasis of anti-racist interventions. Psychologists have typically framed the fight against racism as reducing individual prejudice or changing racist attitudes, and have designed effective programs to address this goal. Standard approaches to prejudice reduction seem to imply that the formerly racist individual, equipped with new attitudes, will now be anti-racist. In addition, this strategy implies that racially marginalized groups should accept a reduction of prejudice as a substitute for challenging the legacy of historical violence and the enduring, unjust status quo. A systemic approach to anti-racism, by contrast, proposes to change the societal structures that foster racist tendencies (Karpinski & Hilton, 2001). This direction suggests that people might better control automatic racist tendencies by disengaging from experiences that promote racism and, instead, cultivate experiences that reinforce anti-racist tendencies. For example, interventions that increase engagement with diversity may lead participants to seek out diverse social communities or conversations that can promote non-racist attitudes (see Gurin et al., 2008). The systemic approach to addressing racism also calls for dismantling racist structures that continue to cause harm, above and beyond the prejudices of any individual person. This includes challenging popular accounts of history; namely, progress narratives that promote the idea that society was once racist but now has overcome racism (Richeson, 2020). Such challenges emphasize: understanding the experiences of people who belong to historically marginalized groups exposing and reforming racist laws and institutional policies including alternative narratives of history that include the voices and understandings of marginalized communities raising awareness of privilege among members of dominant groups One example of work in this direction involves challenging traditional notions of merit (Croizet, 2008). Specifically, intelligence tests, college entrance exams, and other assessments of “ability” or “aptitude” have been used to discriminate against people of color. Although these types of tests often yield differences in scores between members of various racial groups, these differences do not suggest that members of dominant groups are smarter or have more potential. Instead, they reflect inequalities in test familiarity, test preparation and support, educational support, and similar factors. Other examples of challenging common attitudes involve challenging conceptions of fairness (Jones, 1998; Smith & Crosby, 2008), national identity (Gurin et al., 2008), and accounts of history (Sears, 2008; Yellow Bird, 2004). Intersectional Considerations One of the complicating factors in successfully addressing racism is intersectionality . Rooted in Black feminist scholarship and critical race theory, intersectionality is the idea that people’s lived experience of oppression is based on more than a single identity. Intersectional analyses consider the oppression that arises out of the combination of various forms of discrimination which produces something distinctive from any one form of discrimination alone. One of the earliest recorded accounts of intersectionality dates back to the 1851 Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio where a former slave, –Sojourner Truth– delivered her famous “Ain’t I a woman?” speech. In it, she provided an account of Black women born into slavery at the intersections of race and gender. In the 1990s, Kimberlé Crenshaw popularized the term intersectionality to describe the exclusion of Black women from feminist discourse (which equated women with White) and conversations about racism (which equated Black with men). Intersectionality situates experience within a complex web of power relations including dimensions such as race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, class, dis/ability, and sexuality (Anthias & Yuval-Davis, 1983; Crenshaw, 1989; Collins & Bilge, 2020 ; hooks, 2000; Hurtado, 1998). Attention to intersectionality can help us move beyond dichotomous formulations (e.g. us–them, oppressor–oppressed) to better appreciate the personal and cultural experiences that structure our everyday lives in distinct yet interrelated ways (Grewal & Kaplan, 2001). Intersectional analyses elevate the often-ignored experiences of people in marginalized identity positions ( Matsuda, 1 9 87 ). Accordingly, a primary contribution of intersectional analyses is to rethink standard accounts of knowledge (Kurtiş & Adams, 2016) and reimagine society from the perspective of those in marginalized positions. Conclusion Psychology has played a pivotal role in the struggle against racism since decades. Scholars have produced nuanced accounts about the dynamics of individual prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Yet, persisting inequalities and racism reveal that efforts at research, intervention, and education remain incomplete. In this module, we have proposed that one direction for action is a systemic approach to racism. From this perspective, racism is not an issue of biased individuals, but instead, a historically rooted and enduring cultural pattern embedded in everyday laws, policies, and social attitudes that can cause harm for people from oppressed groups. Racism can also create advantages for people from dominant groups, even if they are unaware of these benefits or have no personal intention to discriminate. Accordingly, anti-racist efforts require greater attention to multiple and intersecting systems of oppression. These efforts compel us to pay attention to both how environmental patterns of racism shape individual experience, but also processes by which even good-intentioned individuals can unknowingly reproduce systems of racism. Vocabulary Automatic Automatic biases are unintended, immediate, and irresistible. Aversive racism Aversive racism is unexamined racial bias that the person does not intend and would reject, but that avoids inter-racial contact. Blatant biases Blatant biases are conscious beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing to admit, are mostly hostile, and openly favor their own group. Discrimination Discrimination is behavior that advantages or disadvantages people merely based on their group membership. Implicit Association Test Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures relatively automatic biases that favor own group relative to other groups. Model minority A minority group whose members are perceived as achieving a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average. Prejudice Prejudice is an evaluation or emotion toward people merely based on their group membership. Right-wing authoritarianism Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) focuses on value conflicts but endorses respect for obedience and authority in the service of group conformity. Self-categorization theory Self-categorization theory develops social identity theory’s point that people categorize themselves, along with each other into groups, favoring their own group. Social dominance orientation Social dominance orientation (SDO) describes a belief that group hierarchies are inevitable in all societies and even good, to maintain order and stability. Social identity theory Social identity theory notes that people categorize each other into groups, favoring their own group. Stereotype Content Model Stereotype Content Model shows that social groups are viewed according to their perceived warmth and competence. Stereotypes Stereotype is a belief that characterizes people based merely on their group membership. Subtle biases Subtle biases are automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent, but real in their consequences. References Adams, G., & Salter, P. S. (2007).

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”'}]"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”\'}, {\'title\': \'Why Does Racial Inequality Persist? | Manhattan Institute\', \'url\': \'https://manhattan.institute/article/why-does-racial-inequality-persist\', \'content\': \'Racial Inequality: A Conceptual Framework Over the last 40 years, I’ve explored why, notwithstanding the success of the civil rights movement, the subordinate status of African-Americans persists. Key to my thinking about this intractable problem has been the need to distinguish the role played by discrimination against black people from that played by counterproductive behavioral patterns among blacks. This puts what is a very sensitive issue rather starkly. Many vocal advocates for racial equality have been loath to consider the possibility that problematic patterns of behavior could be an important factor contributing to our persisting disadvantaged status. Some observers on the right of American politics, meanwhile, take the position that discrimination against blacks is no longer an important determinant of unequal social outcomes. I have long tried to chart a middle course—acknowledging antiblack biases that should be remedied while insisting on addressing and reversing the patterns of behavior that impede black people from seizing newly opened opportunities to prosper. I still see this as the most sensible position. These two positions can be recast as causal narratives. One is what I call the “bias narrative”: racism and white supremacy have done us wrong; we can’t get ahead until they relent; so we must continue urging the reform of white American society toward that end. The other is what I call the “development narrative,” according to which it is essential to consider how a person comes to acquire those skills, traits, habits, and orientations that foster successful participation in American society. To the extent that African-American youngsters do not have the experiences, are not exposed to the influences, and do not benefit from the resources that foster and facilitate their human development, they fail to achieve their full human potential. This lack of development is what ultimately causes the persistent, stark racial disparities in income, wealth, education, family structure, and much else. (The charts and tables on this and the next several pages offer a glimpse of the magnitude of these disparities.) In terms of prescribing intervention and remedy, these causal narratives point in very different directions. The bias narrative says that we need to have a “conversation” about race: white America must reform itself; racism must end; we need more of this or that, whatever the “this” or “that” is on the agenda of today’s race reformers. One hears this kind of talk, one reads these exhortations, in newspapers and other media every day. The development narrative puts more onus on the responsibilities of African-Americans to develop our human potential. It is not satisfied with wishful thinking like: “If we could only double the budget for some social program, the homicide rate among young African-American men would be less atrocious.” Or, “If we can just get this police department investigated by the Department of Justice, then.…” The development narrative asks, Then what? Then it will be safe to walk on the south side of Chicago after midnight? Meanwhile, the terms themselves—race and discrimination—are often bandied about without being rigorously defined. In a 2002 book, The Anatomy of Racial Inequality , I sketched a theory of race applicable to the social and historical circumstances of the U.S., speculated about why racial inequalities persist, and advanced a conceptual framework for thinking about social justice in matters of race.[ 1 ] Because there remains so much confusion in today’s public discussions about race and racial inequality, I need to revisit that framework. Bear with me. The relevance of this conceptual excursion will be clear soon enough. Categorization Versus Signification For me, the term “race” refers to indelible and heritable marks on human bodies—skin color, hair texture, bone structure—that are of no intrinsic significance but that nevertheless have, through time, come to be invested with social expectations that are more or less reasonable and social meanings that are more or less durable. When we talk about race in America or anywhere else, we are actually dealing with two distinct processes: categorization and signification. Categorization entails sorting people into a small number of subsets based on bodily marks and differentiating one’s dealings with such persons accordingly. It is a cognitive act—an effort to comprehend the social world around us. Signification is an interpretative act—one that associates certain connotations or “social meanings” with those categories. Informational and symbolic issues are both at play. Or, as I like to put it, when we speak about race, we are really talking about “embodied social signification.”[ 2 ] It is instructive to contrast a social-cognitive conception of race with acts of biological taxonomy—sorting humans based on presumed variations of genetic endowments across what had for eons been geographically isolated subpopulations. Such isolation was, until recently, the human condition, and it may be thought to have led to the emergence of distinct races. Nevertheless, using the term “race” in this way is controversial, particularly if the aim is to explain social inequalities between groups. Thus, scientists, such as the population geneticist Luigi Cavalli-Sforza,[ 3 ] and social critics, such as the philosopher Anthony Appiah,[ 4 ] deny that “race” refers to anything real. What they have in mind is the biological-taxonomic notion, and what they deny is that meaningful distinctions among human subgroups pertinent to accounting for racial inequality can be derived from this notion. I am not arguing this point—though it would appear to be eminently arguable. What I am emphasizing is that to establish the scientific invalidity of race demonstrates neither the irrationality nor the immorality of invoking racial classification as acts of social cognition. So I shall employ the concept of race here, with an emphasis on the negative interpretative/symbolic connotations attached to “blackness” in the U.S.[ 5 ] Reward Bias Versus Development Bias Given this theoretical understanding of race, what might one say about the causes of persistent racial inequality? Fundamental is the elemental distinction I first drew in 2002 between racial discrimination and racial stigma. Discrimination is about how blacks are treated; stigma is about how blacks are perceived. What I call “reward bias” (conventional racial discrimination) is now a less significant barrier to the full participation of African-Americans in U.S. society than what I call “development bias.” Reward bias focuses on the disadvantageous treatment of black people in formal transactions that limits their rewards for skills and talents presented to the market. Development bias refers to impediments that block access for black people to those resources necessary to develop and refine their talents but that are conveyed via informal social relations. This is where the consideration of culture enters the picture. Reward bias is grounded in racially discriminatory transactions , but development bias is ultimately rooted in racially stigmatized social relations . Many resources that foster human development only become available to persons as the by-product of informal, race-influenced social interactions. Another way to put this expanded view of discrimination: reward bias reflects discrimination in contract while development bias reflects discrimination in contact. Obviously, these two forms of bias are not mutually exclusive. The acquisition of skills can be blocked by overt discriminatory treatment, and a regime of market discrimination under pressure from the forces of economic competition may require informal instruments of social control to maintain that discriminatory regime.[ 6 ] Though both kinds of bias promote racial inequality, the distinction is useful. The moral problem presented by reward bias is straightforward and calls for an uncontroversial remedy: laws against overt racial discrimination. Development bias presents a subtler and more insidious ethical challenge that may be difficult to remedy via public policies in any way that garners majoritarian support. Ultimately, development bias deals with some cultural patterns that are characteristic of both a racial minority group and the society at large, while reward bias deals with overt antiblack discriminatory treatment that, even though it has not been fully eliminated, is nevertheless nearly universally condemned. The difficulties for remedying development bias have a cognitive and an ethical dimension. In terms of cognition, when confronted with a racial group’s poor social performance, an observer may be unable to distinguish between blocked developmental opportunities and limited capacities or distorted values. In ethical terms, citizens who find the “transactional discrimination” associated with reward bias to be noxious may be less offended by the covert, subconscious “relational discrimination” that underlies development bias.[ 7 ] Regarding the distinction between reward bias and development bias: to understand persistent racial inequality in America, it is crucial to put relations before transactions. The focus on discriminatory economic transactions may not be sufficient; one will need also to consider the consequences of racially stigmatized social relations. Stigma—the distorted social meanings attaching to “blackness”—inhibits the access that some black people have to those networks of social affiliation where developmental resources are most readily appropriated. This might happen because black people are socially excluded; it might also happen because we choose to be socially withdrawn. On this view, persistent inequality may no longer be due mainly to a racially discriminatory marketplace, or an administrative state that refuses to reward black talent equally, as was the case in decades past. Rather, today’s problem may be due, in large part, to a race-tinged psychology of perception and valuation—a way of seeing black people, and a way of black people seeing themselves, that impedes the acquisition of traits that are valued in the marketplace and are essential for human development. This can lead to a vicious circle. The status of a racial group as stigmatized in the social imagination—and crucially, in its own self-understanding—can be rationalized and socially reproduced because of that group’s subordinate position in the economic order. Moreover, this way of thinking implies that the explanatory categories of “racial discrimination” and “racially distinct behaviors” are not mutually exclusive. Social Capital Versus Human Capital A quarter-century before the publication of The Anatomy of Racial Inequality , I coined the term “social capital” to help account for persistent racial inequality in the U.S.[ 8 ] The concept behind social capital illuminates the difference between informal social relations and formal economic transactions—between reward and development bias—as mechanisms perpetuating the subordinate position of African-Americans. As an economist, I sought to differentiate social capital with the more familiar term in my own field: “human capital.” Human-capital theory attempts to account for variation in people’s earnings capacities by analogy with well-developed theories of investment. These theories begin with the assumption of competitive markets and rational choice by forward-looking individuals, and then analyze investment decisions in light of individuals’ time preferences, their anticipated rates of return, and the available alternatives for uses of their time. Human-capital theory imports into the study of human inequality an intellectual framework that had been well developed in economics to explain the investment decisions of firms—a framework that focuses on the analysis of formal economic transactions. I argued that associating business with human investments is merely an analogy, not an identity—particularly if one seeks to explain persistent racial disparities. Human capital, as an economic concept, overlooks two important facts having to do with informal social relations. First, all human development is socially situated and mediated. Human development takes place between people, by way of human interactions, within social institutions—the family, the community, the school, the peer group. Many resources essential to human development, such as the attention that parents give to their children, are not alienable. These resources, for the most part, are not commodities and are not up for sale. Instead, structured connections between individuals create the context within which developmental resources come to be allocated to individual persons. Opportunity travels along the synapses of these social networks. The resulting allocation of developmental resources need not be responsive to prices or be economically efficient. The development of human beings is not the same as corporate investment, and it is not a good metaphor, or a good analogy, to reason as though this were so. Human development begins before birth. The decisions a mother makes—about how closely to attend to her health and nutrition during pregnancy, for instance—will alter the neurological development of her fetus. This, and a myriad of other decisions and actions, all come together to shape the experience of the infant, who will mature one day to become a human being, and about whom it will be said that he or she has this or that much productivity, as reflected in his or her wages or academic test scores. This productivity, the behavioral and cognitive capacities bearing on a person’s social and economic functioning, are not merely the result of a mechanical infusion of material resources. Rather, these are by-products of social processes mediated by networks of human affiliation, and these processes are fundamentally important for understanding persistent racial disparities. Second, what we call “race” is mainly a social, and only indirectly a biological, phenomenon. The persistence across generations of racial differentiation between large groups of people, in an open society where individuals live in proximity to one another, provides irrefutable indirect evidence of a profound separation between the racially defined networks of social affiliation within that society. There would be no races in the steady state of any dynamic social system unless, on a daily basis and with regard to their most intimate affairs, people paid assiduous attention to the boundaries separating themselves from racially distinct others. Over time, race would cease to exist unless people chose to act in a manner so as biologically to reproduce the variety of phenotypic expression that constitutes the substance of racial distinction. If the goal is to understand durable racial inequality in a society, one needs to attend in detail to the processes that cause race to persist as a fact of life, because such processes will be related to the allocation of human developmental resources in that society. Race, as a feature of a society, rests upon the cultural conceptions about identity held by the people—in America, principally blacks and whites alike—in that society. These are the beliefs that people hold about who they are and about the legitimacy of conducting intimate relations (and not only sexual relations) with racially distinct others. Beliefs of this kind affect the access that people enjoy to those informal resources that individuals require to develop their human potential. Social capital is a critical prerequisite for creating what economists refer to as human capital. Any conceptual framework for the study of persistent racial inequality is incomplete if it fails to consider the interactions between those social processes ensuring the reproduction of racial difference, on one hand, and those processes facilitating human development, on the other hand. If we consider these interactions, it becomes easier to see the many intimate connections between the antiblack “racial bias” that liberals emphasize and the “behavioral pathology” of (some) blacks that (some) conservatives are so keen to focus on. Nobody Is Coming to Save Us I know how difficult it can be to see those connections—it has taken me many years to recognize them. My doctoral dissertation included an essay that was very close to the liberal, “racial bias” narrative. History, I wrote, casts a long shadow. Contemporary racial inequality in America reflects a history of deprivation, discrimination, and dispossession of black people. We can’t expect this problem to cure itself. Thus, social justice rightly understood would involve some kind of reparation. I didn’t use that word, but I did advocate for some intervention by the state on behalf of the explicit goal of racial equality. Otherwise, I reasoned, we would be stuck indefinitely with the consequences of an unjust past.[ 9 ] That was Glenn Loury circa 1976. By 1985, I had become a Reagan Republican, emphasizing the problems of single-parent families, out-of-wedlock births among blacks, low labor-force participation and educational performance, and high criminal and victimization rates. My favored formulation: there is an enemy without—namely, racism; but there is also an enemy within—namely, behavior patterns inhibiting African-Americans from seizing such opportunities as had come to exist. I stressed to other blacks that if we were ever to achieve equality within American society, we could not simply rely on the antidiscrimination laws and affirmative action; we would also have to address some of these internal behavioral patterns. I still believe this to be the case. By pointing to the “enemy within,” I did not deny that the ultimate source of such adverse internal patterns might be historical discrimination. (Although as a social scientist, I recognized that this kind of causal inference question is nearly impossible to resolve convincingly by looking at data.) But it did not matter so much what the ultimate sources of internal behavioral patterns were; what mattered was how they were to be reversed. The majority of African-American children are born to a woman without a husband. It is extremely implausible to imagine how this would be reversed by government policies such as the redistribution of resources. (I am aware of no evidence to this effect.) If this trend is to be reversed at all, it would require a determined effort by African-Americans to think differently about our responsibilities to our children and to one another. And so I would say to fellow African-Americans: No one is coming to save us! The situation in which we find ourselves is unfair, but this is not a question of justice. Nobody is coming, and, more fundamentally, no one can come into the most intimate relations between our women and men, into the families and neighborhoods where our children are being raised, so as to reorder those cultural institutions in a manner that would be more developmentally constructive. These matters are ultimately and necessarily in the hands of African-Americans alone. They require facing up to such questions as: Who are we as a people? How should we live with one another? What will we do to honor the sacrifices that our ancestors made to leave us the opportunities we now enjoy? What do we owe our children? Think about black-on-black crime. Unemployment rates, wealth holdings, residential segregation, and biased policing all may be playing some role in this problem. But young black men are killing one another at extraordinary rates. Notwithstanding the potential beneficial effects of various social policies, no one is coming to save black people from that pathology. If we are not prepared to condemn this contemptible behavior and to cooperate with institutions of civil authority that are legitimately addressing it—if we are unable to recognize that this is a tragic failure with the way that black people are living—we will likely be facing exactly the same issues for many years to come. "Bias Narratives" Can Take on (Viral) Lives of Their Own Today, as social-justice warriors take to the streets to protest against racism, it is important to recognize the role played by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media. Many people get news from online sources that play to the narrative that American society is overwhelmingly populated by white bigots; so incidents that are not at all representative nevertheless become iconic because they go viral. A student finds something resembling a noose near his dorm-room door; a security guard says to someone, “I am unsure whether you belong here. Let me see your ID”; customers are asked to leave a food-service establishment when the manager thinks that their behavior is inconsistent with the establishment’s rules. These incidents become national events. It is not simply that something has happened, or that a lot of people know about something having happened. Rather, what matters is that a lot of people know that many people know of the incidents in question. Idiosyncratic occurrences then become “driving while black,” “barbecuing while black,” “swimming while black,” “shopping while black,” “walking while black,” and so forth. The narrative of pervasive antiblack racism becomes a trope. When millions of people focus on the same events and reinforce one another in their comments, declaring one’s outrage at such incidents becomes a substitute for reasoning about what larger meaning, if any, should be attached to these events. I often ask people who tell me about these incidents: Why do we care? Why should I care whether a woman was asked to put out her cigarette when a police officer stopped her for a broken taillight on a dusty road in Texas? Is that supposed to be emblematic of the treatment of black people in this country? As a social scientist, I am loath to operate based on a few anecdotes. For many who embrace the bias narrative, however, that’s what is happening. Incidents that are not representative but that are salient within a bias narrative go viral and shape the consciousness of many. The viral social construction of episodes that are not the substance of our lives comes to shape our politics via exaggerated projections onto the surface of our lives. This is not “politics”—if, by that term, we understand mechanisms of give-and-take and persuasion by means of which we govern ourselves. It is, rather, a certain kind of mass delusion. A big part of the problem is virtue signaling. Only certain kinds of (immoral) people would refuse to go along with these delusions, and too many of us wish not to be thought of as being one of those people, so we avoid expressing skepticism publicly. To do so—to repeat things being said by those who scoff at the outrage of the day and are thought to be racists—risks devaluing one’s reputation among “progressives.” My theory of political correctness: a cognitive and intellectual dead end where too many people are motivated to remain silent on critical questions, to voice empty platitudes, or even to say things that they don’t believe, all by their need to avoid appearing as though they’re on the wrong side of history.[ 10 ] Those Who Downplay Behavioral Disparities Are Bluffing People on the left of American politics who claim that “white supremacy,” “implicit bias,” and old-fashioned discrimination account for black disadvantage are daring you to disagree. Their implicit rebuke is that, if you do not agree, you are saying that there’s something intrinsically wrong with black people, or with black culture; you must be a racist who thinks that blacks are inferior. Otherwise, they say, how else could one explain the disparities? Behavior? That leads to the accusation that you are “blaming the victim.” But this is a bluff. It is a rhetorical sleight-of-hand, a debater’s trick. Why? Consider a statement that “mass incarceration,” the high number of blacks in jails and prisons, is self-evidently a sign of American racism. If you respond that it’s mainly a sign of the pathological behavior of criminals who happen to be black, you risk being called a racist. Yet common sense, not to mention the evidence, suggests that people are not being arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced because they are black. Rather, prisons are full of people who have broken the law, who have hurt other people, who have violated the basic rules of civility. Prison is not a conspiracy to confine black people. I maintain that no serious person believes that it is. Not really. The young black men taking one another’s lives on the streets of St. Louis, Baltimore, and Chicago are exhibiting behavioral pathology, plain and simple. The people they kill are mainly black, and the families who live with the misery are mainly black. Ascribing that to white racism is laughable. Nobody believes it. Not really. Consider educational test-score data. Antiracism advocates are, in effect, daring you to say that some groups send their children to the elite universities in outsize numbers compared with other groups because their academic preparation is magnitudes higher and better. Such excellence is an achievement.[ 11 ] One is not born with the knowledge, skills, and academic ability to gain admission into elite colleges. The people who acquire these skills do so through effort. Why do some youngsters acquire the skills while others do not? That is a deep question requiring a serious answer. The simple answer—that this disparity is due to racism, and anyone who says otherwise is a racist—is not serious. Do such disparate outcomes have nothing to do with behavior, with cultural patterns, with what peer groups value, with how people spend their time, with what they identify as being critical to their self-respect? Anyone who believes that is, at best, a fool. Asians are said, sardonically, to be a “model minority.” As a matter of fact, quite a compelling case can be made that “culture” is critical to their success. Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou interviewed Asian families in Southern California, trying to learn how their kids get into Dartmouth, Columbia, and Cornell at such high rates.[ 12 ] They found that these families do exhibit cultural patterns, embrace values, adopt practices, engage in behavior, and follow disciplines that orient them so as to facilitate the achievements of their children. It defies common sense, as well as the evidence, to assert that they do not, or, conversely, to assert that the paucity of African-Americans performing at the very top of the intellectual spectrum—I am talking about academic excellence and about the low relative numbers of blacks who exhibit it—has nothing to do with behavior, that it is due entirely to institutional forces. That is an absurdity. Some 70% of African-American babies are born to a woman without a husband. Is this a good thing? Is it due to the ongoing practice of antiblack racism? Some people say these things. Do they really believe these things, or are they daring you to deny them? The 21st-century failures of too many African-Americans to take advantage of the opportunities created by the civil rights revolution are palpable, yet they are denied at every turn. This position is untenable. The end of Jim Crow segregation and the advent of equal rights for blacks were game changers. A half-century later, the deep disparities that remain are shameful and are due in large part to the behaviors of black people. People tout the racial wealth gap as, ipso facto, an indictment of the system—even while black Caribbean and African immigrants are starting businesses, penetrating the professions, and presenting themselves at Ivy League institutions in outsize numbers. They are behaving, although black, like other immigrant groups in our nation’s past. True, they are immigrants, not natives, and immigration can be positively selectived. But something is dreadfully wrong when adverse patterns of behavior readily visible in the black American population go without being adequately discussed—to the point that anybody daring to mention them is labeled a racist. Thus, the Obama administration’s Department of Education issued a “Dear Colleague Letter”[ 13 ] that sought to cajole local school districts around the country to narrow the racial disparity in the suspension rates of students for disruptive behavior. The letter was supposedly advice—but failure to narrow the disparity meant that the district could be found guilty of a civil rights violation and potentially lose federal funding. Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, rescinded that letter—resulting in a great deal of consternation. Of course, if teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and school-based police officers are discriminating by race when they discipline students, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice should get involved. But based on all that we know—for instance, about crime and incarceration rates—it is at least plausible that there is an objective racial disparity in the frequency of disruptive behavior that occasions a difference in the suspension statistics. If behavior, not racism, is at the bottom of racially disparate suspension rates, think of the disservice being done—to the schoolchildren who act out (by failing to teach the lesson that bad behavior has consequences), to classmates (including, of course, minority students) who are hindered from getting an education by disruptive classroom behavior, and to teachers, who are trying to maintain a safe environment for learning. One more example of how this bluffing can do harm: the affirmative-action debate. We are now on the verge of permanently including African-Americans in elite and selective academic institutions through an openly acknowledged use of different standards. That is horrible—and not because of the Fourteenth Amendment, though the Supreme Court may yet find it so. It’s horrible because this is not equality. It is patronizing. It is horrible for black Americans to embrace, and the establishment to adopt, a set of practices rooted in the soft bigotry of low expectations. Yet other than Clarence Thomas, Thomas Sowell, and a few others, there is not even a debate among African-Americans about what should be a first-order question, if the goal is to attain genuine racial equality. No Responsibility Means No Glory If the negative cultural patterns in some African-American communities are said to be a necessary consequence of oppression, what is one to make of positive cultural patterns of behavior? Are they, too, a necessary consequence of oppression? If an individual or a community refuses to take responsibility for failure, how can they claim any glory for success? No blame? No skin in the game? Then no credit. You cannot help the hand you are dealt; but you can decide how to play it. To cast oneself as a helpless victim, to filter experience constantly and at every instance through a sieve that catches everything that one has control over while leaving the outcome to invisible, implacable historical forces: something is pathetic about that posture. The struggle for equal rights for black people, from abolition through the civil rights movement, has always been thought of as a “freedom struggle.” But with freedom, rightly understood, comes responsibility. It is past time for all of us to start performing without a net. Rather than lamenting the lack of black billionaires, an outcome ascribed to some invisible force called “racism,” one can admit that you will never become a billionaire unless you build a billion-dollar business—which begins by starting a business. One will never win a Nobel Prize in physics unless one learns calculus at the age of 12. What black parents are insisting that their 12-year-old kids learn calculus—those few kids capable of doing so? White people are not responsible for the fact that black people are, or are not, doing this. Not All Black People Are the Same All this having been said about the behavioral roots of racial inequality, it is dangerous to talk about “black culture” as if it were only one thing—with pathological behavior (such as high levels of urban violence) becoming a stereotype about all black people. Here an insight by UCLA sociologist Rogers Brubaker is crucial for understanding race and inequality: one should never invoke racial aggregates as the subjects of social analysis unreflectively.[ 14 ] This is a major concern among African-Americans about “culture talk.” Culture talk overly focuses on pathology; but many positive things could be mentioned that will not typically appear in an op-ed. Black people are not a this or a that. They are a population in excess of 30 million, with cultural patterns as variegated as one would expect in such a large aggregation. Moreover, American society is a polyglot mixture where cultural dynamics influence one another. For example, some middle-class, suburban white kids download rap music produced by black artists from the inner city. These musicians come to have a market substantially influenced by the preferences of their middle-class white customers. To a certain degree, they play to that audience, including that audience’s stereotypes about thuggish behavior. Along comes a schoolteacher who announces: “Rap music is bad, and it’s pathological. Can’t you see just how troubled black people are?” This is ludicrous—how is it that a few hundred musicians and artists responding to a national market consisting mostly of white customers suddenly become emblematic of black culture or black people? Another example involves the drug trade, which in the U.S. is worth billions of dollars annually and includes marijuana, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, and crystal meth. It involves people of every race in every geographic location and every walk of life. But the street trafficking in drugs in large urban areas is largely in the hands of black and Latino youth—in substantial part because the only people who would do such dangerous, low-paying work are those whose alternative employment opportunities are scant. It is no surprise that those incarcerated for street-level trafficking are disproportionately blacks. Their arrests and imprisonment are not in themselves evidence of racism—or evidence of black culture. But given the bare facts of racial stigma in American society, many observers will be inclined to think so. We’re All in This Together—at Least We’re Supposed to Be This point about racial stigma is fundamental. Without understanding it, one might say (as many conservative commentators do), “Look at recent immigrants from Asia and even from Latin America. They, too, have been victims in various ways. Yet they have advanced in our society even as the blacks of inner-city Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Oakland continue to lag. Whatever is wrong with those people?” In effect: “It must be something about ‘those people,’ not about us , that causes them to be so backward.” By looking at America this way, one eschews social, political, and moral responsibility for the plight of those people. One will conclude that blacks’ failure to develop their human potential reflects the absence of such potential (and there are books making that argument), or it reflects a backward culture that, sadly but inevitably (“What more can we do?”) causes them to lag behind. Yet blacks are not the authors of the stigma that engenders developmental bias against them. When we understand that the way people come to value things or make decisions is partly created via interactions in society, their flourishing, or lack thereof, reflects on society as a whole, as well as on themselves. It reflects on an “us,” not merely on “them.” The mistake is to ignore the extent to which racial inequality reflects not only cultural patterns among insular groups of people but also the interactions that run through society. To impute a causal role to what one takes to be intrinsic cultural traits of a subordinate racial group, while failing to see the systemwide context out of which dysfunctional cultural patterns emerged, is to commit a significant error of social cognition. That members of a particular group seem to perform less well routinely on a set of transactions of interest is a matter not of a cultural essence but of the network of social relations that has (or has not) prepared the members of that group for those transactions. In the U.S. context, “blackness” is associated with stigmatizing meanings. This stigma leads nonblack people to be reluctant to enter into intimate social or individual relations with them, which in turn affects the social allocation of developmental resources. People don’t make social judgments based on straightforward benefit-cost calculations. Rather, they often act on identity considerations. They ask such questions as: Who am I? How should I live? With whom should I associate? When should I extend to this “other” a benefit of the doubt? Racial inequality is, in substantial part, the outcome of a system of nonmarket social interactions such as these that entangle us together. Consider the high out-of-wedlock birthrates among blacks. This pattern of behavior has consequences for socioeconomic racial disparities. But that is not the whole story. Racial intermarriage rates in the U.S. remain quite low (though they have risen in recent decades).[ 15 ] The reasons for this low rate are unclear. Are black women, perhaps, receiving marriage proposals from white men and turning them down? I don’t know. But I strongly suspect that a low rate of cross-boundary mating between these two groups has implications for human development, for resources available to children, and for the generation and transmission of wealth. Moreover, the low rate of intermarriage has implications for the dating and mating market among blacks because they are a small minority of the population—roughly one in eight Americans. If white men and black women were marrying at a higher rate, black men and black women would be interacting in a different way. To observe a social equilibrium in which blacks and whites exhibit different out-of-wedlock birthrates and, on the basis of that observation, to impute the difference to something called black culture, reflects one’s failure to see how the intra-racial marriage market is nested within a larger context, where a higher rate of cross-boundary mating could substantially alter intra-boundary behavior. What may be perceived as a characteristic of “those people” (Why don’t they marry? Why do they bear their children in such a disorderly manner?) might be seen instead as a question about society as a whole. From the perspective of the white population, perhaps the real question about out-of-wedlock births is: “Why do we avoid intimacy with them?” I use “us,” “we,” “them” to emphasize how stigma operates. It operates in the very definition of who one understands to be the social “we.” How a society answers the question, “Who are we?” has far-reaching implications. When Americans talk about crime, violence, school failure, and urban decay, do we understand these matters as “us versus them”? If so, it becomes possible to say, regarding people languishing in the ghettos of our great cities: “That’s not my country. That’s some third-world thing.” This was actually said during the flood of New Orleans that followed Hurricane Katrina. But black people have been in New Orleans for 250 years. They’re not aliens. They’re as American as anybody can be. That was us crawling up on the rooftops. That was us huddled in the Superdome. The abject poverty that was exposed to a national audience after the flood was a quintessentially American affair, not simply a measure of the inadequacy of black culture. It reflected as well upon our social inadequacy. The perspective I am promoting about social capital does not require special, race-targeted social policy. Most policy initiatives aimed at improving the lives of our most disadvantaged citizens should not, and need not, be formulated in explicitly racial terms or understood as a remedy for racial injuries. We have to find what works for disadvantaged people in America, period. If we get that right—if we can fashion an American welfare state consistent with our demographic realities, our own values, and our fiscal capacities—we will go a very long way toward assisting African-Americans to develop their full human potential. Finding what works is especially pertinent for education policy. Disadvantaged youngsters who live in large cities are poorly served by the majority–minority school districts on which they and their parents must rely. This is a huge area for policy innovation, with respect to charter schools and increased options for parents. Yet black politicians who speak publicly on the issue are virtually unanimous in adopting the hostility toward charter schools that animates the country’s largest teachers’ union, the National Education Association. Thus, at the NAACP’s annual board meeting in Cincinnati in 2016, delegates were overwhelmed by black American parents who had stormed the meeting to protest that the organization’s board was about to endorse a resolution that opposed more funding for charter schools in various states.[ 16 ] Are police good or bad for the security and safety of black lives in U.S. cities? It is hard to imagine a more important question. Yet one is hard-pressed to find any effective political debate among African-Americans. Instead, we get the shopworn and ineffective stances that people on the left are taking. Social-justice warriors are supposed to care about black lives. But if they did, they’d seriously care about securing the safety and property of African-Americans in the South Bronx, the west side of Chicago, and other cities. A real argument is to be had over public safety and the role of the police, and the answers are far from self-evident. Yet I’m not sure that social-justice warriors care about black lives. They seem to care more about remaining in lockstep with fashionable liberal opinion. Conclusion: Who Are We? How should we think about the persistence of racial inequality in America? To deny the relevance of behavioral patterns among some black families and communities is folly. To wash one’s hands of their problems because of such cultural and behavioral impediments is profoundly unjust. There are no easy answers, but I suggest that the view here is worth considering as a way to account for, and then respond to, an enduring dilemma that confronts and frustrates us still. Take the poor central-city dwellers who make up perhaps a quarter of the African-American population. The dysfunctional behavior of many in this population does account for much of their failure to progress—and conservatives’ demand for greater personal responsibility is necessary and proper. Yet, confronted with the despair, violence, and self-destructive behavior of so many people, it seems morally superficial in the extreme to argue, as many conservatives do, that “those people should just get their acts together; if they did, like many of the poor immigrants, we would not have such a horrific problem in our cities.” To the contrary, any morally astute response to the social pathology of American history’s losers would have to conclude that, while we cannot change our ignoble past, we must not be indifferent to contemporary suffering issuing directly from that past. Their culture may be implicated in their difficulties, but so is our culture complicit in their troubles; we bear collective responsibility for the form and texture of our social relations. While we cannot ignore the behavioral problems of the so-called black underclass, we should discuss and react to those problems as if we were talking about our own children, neighbors, and friends. It will require adjusting ways of thinking on both sides of the racial divide. Achieving a well-ordered society, where all members are embraced as being among us, should be the goal. Our failure to do so is an American tragedy. It is a national, not merely a communal, disgrace. Changing the definition of the American “we” is a first step toward rectifying the relational discrimination that afflicts our society, and it is the best path forward in reducing racial inequality.

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”'}, {'title': 'Changing social norms is the key to addressing racism', 'url': 'https://www.environicsinstitute.org/insights/insight-details/changing-social-norms-is-the-key-to-addressing-racism', 'content': 'Published in T he Globe and Mail, February 6, 2021 By Keith Neuman and Michael Adams When the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread in North America last March, it was hard to imagine anything else capturing a large share of public attention in the ensuing months. And then, in May, video footage of the horrific murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police ignited a blaze of protest that spread across the United States and also Canada, a country with its own history of colonialism and racism. The depth of the reflection and conversation – public and private – provoked by the protests was unprecedented. For the first time, many of this country’s leaders unequivocally acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in Canada, and reflected the predominant public sentiment. Our own research shows that a significant majority of Canadians now recognize the reality of racial discrimination in this country, especially as it affects people who are Indigenous and Black. Such recognition of racism in our society is a significant milestone, long in coming. Doing something about it becomes the next step, and represents an even greater challenge given how deeply such prejudice is embedded in Canada’s dominant culture and institutions. Evidence of its pervasiveness confronts us both in personal anecdotes and in hard data on racial disparities across many areas of society – from policing and health to education and social welfare. It is commonly believed that the biggest obstacle to meaningful change is our inability to recognize our own racial prejudices. The prevalence of unconscious racism or “implicit bias” has been well documented by American social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt (in her seminal book, Biased) and others. Some have responded by taking steps to make the implicit explicit through education generally, and diversity and anti-racism training in particular. Governments and corporations have invested in programs to teach employees about bias and stereotypes, hoping that raising consciousness will change attitudes, assumptions, and behaviour. But the evidence is emerging that this strategy is not effective in producing lasting change, as recently reported in a meta-analysis of close to 1,000 studies of anti-bias interventions. Efforts to reduce bias through education and training may simply not work because it is impossible to change people’s ingrained mindsets and emotions, at least in the short term. A more promising avenue to consider is the social context in which people operate when they interact with others. Implicit in diversity training is the idea that racism is fuelled mainly by what people know and think, but what matters more is what people say and how they behave in the presence of others. Outward expressions of racism are governed in large part by collective social norms about acceptable behaviour. The term “norms” sometimes gets mentioned in the context of problematic content on social media, but what has yet to receive any serious attention is the concept of “social norms” as a fundamental aspect of society that contributes to the systemic nature of racism and where we might focus to address the problem. Social norms are widely held expectations about what is, and is not, acceptable to say and do in particular situations. What is distinctive about such norms is that they are not defined by what people think is important to them personally, but by what they see as the social expectations of others whose opinions matter to them. As such, norms exert a powerful influence on how people act in public and social situations, quite apart from what they may think or feel inside. These norms are typically well entrenched but do change over time. The Holocaust led many people to decide it was no longer acceptable to articulate anti-Jewish stereotypes. The growing awareness of LGBTQ individuals in society and the legislative endorsement of same-sex marriage both improved attitudes and also made it no longer socially acceptable to trade in homophobic slurs. Many people may still harbour negative views about Jews and LGBTQ people, but most now understand it is no longer okay to express them. Sometimes social norms change as a result of intentional efforts. Arguably the most striking example is the successful campaign to change norms around tobacco use in public. Just over a generation ago, smoking in public was common, even cool. Today, the behaviour has become effectively “denormalized” as inconsiderate and self-defeating, even as a significant proportion of the population continues to smoke in private. Regulatory measures that restrict smoking in public settings are also important, but it is the norms more than the laws that govern behaviour. By contrast, consider jaywalking, which is also legally forbidden but widely socially accepted. Social norms play a key role in the dynamics of racism and prejudice because they establish the boundaries around which people act toward those they see as “other.” While internal attitudes and stereotypes are stubbornly resistant to short-term change, action and speech are more amenable to influence and normative pressures. This means that focusing on social norms can be an effective strategy for addressing racism in a meaningful way – especially if the collective norms against intolerance and discrimination are strengthening, which now appears to be happening. Evidence for this can be found in the recent public condemnation of wearing “blackface” in costume, which in a different era was considered by many to be harmless party attire. There is nothing new about the concept of social norms, which social scientists have studied in academic settings and applied to public health challenges in developing countries. What has been missing is the practical application of this science to important societal problems like racism, as well as other pressing challenges such as promoting physical distancing during a pandemic. The essential starting point is to first properly define and measure specific social norms about race-related actions and speech in order to determine their breadth and strength across the population ( a type of research our Institute now plans to undertake ). Such information can then point to where interventions might be directed – to reinforce “positive norms” that are currently prevalent in society (no wearing of blackface) and de-normalizing “negative norms” (e.g., telling jokes that demean the “other”). This might take the form of public awareness campaigns (as was done to de-normalize public smoking) or employee-directed programs. Government and corporate leaders might be effective communicators of appropriate normative behaviour, to the extent they are credible and can exert influence over relevant audiences (which research might confirm). Today in Canada, our understanding of the current reality of racial injustice is at odds with our stated aspirations of justice and inclusion. This tension provides us with a valuable opportunity to create a more just society by developing new strategies that effectively apply normative pressures on each other to do a better job of treating each other as we ourselves expect to be treated.

The starkest divides are in measures of household wealth, reflecting centuries of white privilege that have made it particularly difficult for people of color to achieve economic security. This series of charts begins with a look at how the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequalities. Racial Wealth Divide By the middle of the 21st century, the United States will be a “majority minority” nation. If we hope to ensure a strong middle class, historically the backbone of the national economy, then improving the financial health of households of color will become even more urgent than it is today. Closing the persistent “wealth divide” between white households and households of color, already a matter of social justice, must become a priority for broader economic policy. Public policies that favor white Americans and the wealthy have perpetuated both an extreme concentration of wealth and an extreme racial wealth divide. White households, Federal Reserve data show, held 84.2 percent of all U.S. wealth as of the fourth quarter of 2023, while making up only 66 percent of households. By contrast, Black families accounted for 11.4 percent of households and owned 3.4 percent of total family wealth, while Hispanic families represented 9.6 percent of households and owned 2.3 percent of total family wealth. These wealth figures include the value of consumer durable goods, such as vehicles. The racial wealth divide, according to Survey of Consumer Finances data, has narrowed slightly since 1989, but remains extremely wide. The median Black family has a net worth (including cars and other durable goods) of $44,100, just 15.5 percent of the $282,310 median white wealth. The typical Latino family, with $62,120, owns just 21.8 percent of the wealth of the median white family. The Institute for Policy Studies report, Ten Solutions to Bridge the Racial Wealth Divide , offers proposals for bold, structural reforms to address this problem. Families that have zero or even “negative” wealth (meaning the value of their debts exceeds the value of their assets) live on the edge, just one minor economic setback away from tragedy. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Federal Reserve data show that while the racial wealth gap has improved slightly, an estimated 28 percent of Black households and 26 percent of Latino households had zero or negative wealth in 2019, twice the level of whites. As with total wealth, home ownership is heavily skewed towards white families, our 2023 report with the National Community Reinvestment, Still a Dream , shows. Between 1960 and 2020, the rate of Black home ownership increased but the gap in ownership rates between Black and white families widened, from 26 percentage points to 30. Structural barriers, including lower incomes, higher rates of mortgage denials, and racial segregation, deny many Black families the opportunity to acquire this wealth-building asset. Black people also have to deal with larger student debt burdens. Black students on average have to take out larger loans to get through college than their white peers. A National Center for Education Statistics study reveals that Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree graduates face 13 percent and 26 percent more student debt, respectively, than their white peers. The challenge of paying off greater student debt is also worsened for Black graduates due to their lower average incomes. Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree holders earn 27 percent and 14 percent lower incomes , respectively, than whites with the same degree. Racial Income Inequality In 2021, Fortune 500 CEOs, who earned $18.3 million on average, included just four Black and 17 Latino people — just 4 percent of the total. By contrast, these groups made up 43 percent of the U.S. workers who would benefit from a raise in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, according to Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Economic Policy Institute data. Black and Latino people comprise 31 percent of the entire U.S. labor force. The world’s wealthiest country is home to numerous communities that have been poor for generations: think parts of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the southern border, and Chicago’s South Side. An Economic Innovation Group report finds that people of color are far more likely to live in “persistently poor” communities – defined as those with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher for at least 30 years – than white Americans. Racial discrimination in many forms, including in education, hiring, and pay practices, contributes to persistent earnings gaps. As of the third quarter of 2023, the median white worker made 24 percent more than the typical Black worker and around 28 percent more than the median Latino worker, according to BLS data . Race and Gender Inequality Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. While student loan burdens have grown significantly for all racial groups, they are particularly heavy for Black students — especially women. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, 43.3 percent of Black women are shouldering student loan debts, compared to just 15.7 percent of white men. Racial inequality in terms of the official poverty rate is also particularly acute for women of color. As National Women’s Law Center research shows, while in 2019 the U.S. poverty rate for white men is 6.0 percent, it is 18 percent for Black women, 15 percent for the Latino community, and 18 percent for Native American women. Racial Inequality and Covid-19 According to APM Research Lab , white and Asian Americans have substantially lower Covid-19 mortality rates than those of other racial and ethnic groups. Between the start of the pandemic and October 2, 2022, indigenous people suffered 582 deaths per 100,000 people – more than twice the death rate for whites and Asians. People of color are more likely to suffer severe illness from Covid-19, regardless of their age. According to CDC data , hospitalization rates have been highest among indigenous and Black Americans. About 2,100 indigenous and 1,700 Black Americans were hospitalized for Covid-related symptoms per 100,000 people in their respective ethnic and race groups between the beginning of the pandemic and October 22, 2022. The racial disparities in Covid-related health indicators have contributed to a steeper decline in the U.S. life expectancy for people of color, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the CDC. Between 2019 and 2021, American Indians and Alaska natives experienced the biggest drop, with life expectancy at birth plunging by more than 6 years to 65.2. The Latino and Black communities both experienced a drop of four years, while Asian and white Americans have seen a decrease of about two years since the start of the pandemic. The pandemic-related economic crisis in 2020 was particularly devastating for people of color. When the shutdown sent unemployment levels skyrocketing in March and April of that year, Black and Latino workers were much more likely to be jobless than white workers, according to BLS data . This remained true despite the fact that people of color made up a disproportionate share of essential workers who had to remain on the job at the start of the pandemic. While the overall unemployment rate has dropped significantly, racial disparities remain. As of October 2023, the unemployment rate for Black workers was 5.8 percent, compared to just 3.9 percent for U.S. workers as a whole. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the share of U.S. workers who are teleworking for health reasons, but not everyone has the same ability to work from home. According to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Occupational Safety (NIOSH) and Health, Black and Non-white Hispanic workers are less likely to report being able to telework than white and Asian workers. Some 38 percent of Asian workers and 24 percent of white workers reported working from home between May 2020 and July 2021. By contrast, only 19 percent of Black and 14 percent and Non-white Hispanic workers reported working from home in that same time period. The researchers attributed 80 percent of this divide to racial education gaps, since college graduates are more likely to be able to telework. Workers of color with public-facing jobs have been exposed to greater virus risks.\'}, {\'title\': "Racism Isn\'t the Only Cause of the Racial Wealth Gap", \'url\': \'https://newrepublic.com/article/192099/racial-wealth-gap-roots-racism-capitalism\', \'content\': \'Black Americans emerged from slavery with almost zero wealth, and Schermerhorn vividly captures how tenuous the grip on wealth was for those few Black families who managed to acquire some. Near the end of the Civil War, the Union Army confiscated 400,000 acres of land from Confederate slaveholders in South Carolina, broke it up into 40-acre parcels, and granted it to escaped slaves. But in less than a year, President Andrew Johnson revoked the order, and hundreds of Black families lost their “forty acres and a mule.” By contrast, Congress passed the Homestead Act in 1862, which along with its successors seized 270 million acres of Western land from Native Americans, divided it into 160-acre tracts, and offered it to any white family willing to farm it. By 1934, 1.5 million families, nearly all white, had acquired farms through the program, none of it ever taken away. For Black families who escaped the South, the story was not much different. Harriet Goings moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1873, when she was in her mid-twenties. She was born free to self-emancipated Black parents who escaped to Canada before the Civil War. Though the city was less than 1 percent Black, it was becoming a hub for furniture manufacturing and attracting droves of American job seekers. Harriet took a job as a hairstylist, and even though few white companies hired Black men, Harriet’s husband, Jack Adams, a refugee from South Carolina, established a successful masonry business in the city. Harriet and Jack were the first in a long line of ancestors able to pass down wealth to their children. They gave $9,500 to their daughter Sarah, who in 1923 bought a modest home with her husband in an all-white neighborhood. It did not take long for things to turn south. White families nationwide did everything they could to keep Black families out of their neighborhoods. In the 1930s, “pioneering” Black families like Sarah Adams’s were typically charged 28 percent more than white families for homes in urban white neighborhoods. The Federal Housing Act of 1934 made matters worse, as an FHA manual told underwriters that, for a neighborhood to “retain stability,” it should be “occupied by the same social and racial classes.” Real estate firms created maps that outlined in red neighborhoods that were becoming predominantly Black, discouraging banks from lending in those communities. Homes like Sarah Adams’s plummeted in value. In 1936, her home was appraised at $2,200, roughly one-third of its value six years earlier; by 2000, the neighborhood’s home values had still not recovered.\'}, {\'title\': \'Social and Economic Impacts of Racism | SpringerLink\', \'url\': \'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-2137-6_7\', \'content\': \'Access Economics.

2025-03-30 23:59:00,836 [INFO] sub-answers: [{'parent_q': 'what leads to racism?', 'sub_answers': [{'sub_q': 'What historical factors contribute to racism?', 'answer': 'Historical factors contributing to racism include the creation and perpetuation of racial categories, racial segregation, and systemic inequalities that arose from these practices. These categories foster ingroup loyalty and competition, leading to discrimination. Racial segregation historically entrenched racist beliefs and perceptions, affecting social attitudes toward different races. Furthermore, power dynamics historically favored certain races over others, legislating and institutionalizing racism. Additionally, media has played a role in normalizing and idealizing certain racial biases, while societal passivity has allowed racist structures to persist. These historical elements created a legacy that impacts modern racial dynamics.'}, {'sub_q': 'How do psychological factors play a role in racism?', 'answer': "Psychological factors play a significant role in shaping racism. These include cognitive biases, such as categorization and stereotyping, which lead to ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination. The ingrained nature of these processes can cause individuals to exhibit prejudices and biases that contribute to systemic racism. Additionally, defense mechanisms, like denial and rationalization, protect individuals' worldview and identity, which can perpetuate racism. Cultural and social influences, such as media representation and historical narratives, also impact how people perceive and react to different racial groups. These psychological elements can both maintain and challenge systemic racism, influencing individual behaviors and societal structures."}, {'sub_q': 'What cultural aspects contribute to the persistence of racism?', 'answer': 'Cultural aspects contributing to the persistence of racism include the ingrained social structures and biased cultural narratives that reinforce racial hierarchies. The persistence of racism is supported by cultural practices such as rigid categorization of people into racial groups, maintaining segregation, and promoting in-group loyalty while fostering competition and animosity towards out-groups.

2025-03-30 23:59:07,301 [INFO] LLM Response:
Racism is a complex phenomenon influenced by a multitude of factors across historical, psychological, cultural, social, and economic dimensions:

1. **Historical Factors:** Racism has roots in historical constructs like racial categorization, segregation, and systemic inequalities that have persisted over time. These constructs have historically entrenched power imbalances, creating long-lasting impacts on racial dynamics.

2. **Psychological Factors:** Cognitive biases, such as stereotyping and ingrained automatic preferences for one's in-group over out-groups, contribute to prejudices. Additionally, cultural influences and media representations significantly shape these biases, reinforcing racist attitudes.

3. **Cultural Aspects:** Persistent racist cultural narratives and biases ensure the longevity of racism. Cultural practices emphasize racial grouping and segregation, while media often perpetuates stereotypes and normalizes dominance of certain racial groups over others.

4. **Social Dynamics:** The social organization of racial groups, reinforced by segregated communities and social norms, plays a significant role. While some social norms have evolved to discourage overt racism, underlying attitudes can remain, influenced by media and societal power structures.

5. **Economic Conditions:** Economic disparities often perpetuate racial divisions, with historical and systemic policies contributing to such inequality. Economic disadvantage leads to stereotypes of minorities as economically burdensome, further fueling discrimination.

Understanding these multifaceted contributions provides a more comprehensive picture of how racism is perpetuated and sustained within societies.

Do not introduce new parent questions that have not appeared before.\n   - Each decomposition must map a `parent_q` to a list of `sub_questions`.\n   - You must provide a global `reason` explaining **why** decomposition is needed.\n   - Format:\n     ```json\n     {\n       "reason": "These questions require finer-grained analysis.",\n       "mapping": [\n         {\n           "parent_q": "How does climate change affect agriculture?",\n           "sub_questions": [\n             "How does temperature rise affect crop yield?",\n             "How does drought impact livestock?"\n           ]\n         },\n         {\n           "parent_q": "What are the social impacts of climate change?",\n           "sub_questions": [\n             "How does climate change affect migration patterns?",\n             "What mental health issues are linked to climate change?"\n           ]\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **final_answer**\n   - Use this only when you believe the question can be directly answered, either based on prior knowledge or based on the `<sub-answers>` returned by previous decompositions.\n   - Provide a `reason` explaining **why** a final answer can now be given.\n   - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n\n---\n\n## Observation Rules\n\n- You may receive a block like:\n  ```\n  <sub-answers>\n  [ ... structured list of sub-questions and their summarized answers ... ]\n  </sub-answers>\n  ```\n  This means earlier decomposed questions have been resolved.

And then, in May, video footage of the horrific murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police ignited a blaze of protest that spread across the United States and also Canada, a country with its own history of colonialism and racism. The depth of the reflection and conversation – public and private – provoked by the protests was unprecedented. For the first time, many of this country’s leaders unequivocally acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in Canada, and reflected the predominant public sentiment. Our own research shows that a significant majority of Canadians now recognize the reality of racial discrimination in this country, especially as it affects people who are Indigenous and Black. Such recognition of racism in our society is a significant milestone, long in coming. Doing something about it becomes the next step, and represents an even greater challenge given how deeply such prejudice is embedded in Canada’s dominant culture and institutions. Evidence of its pervasiveness confronts us both in personal anecdotes and in hard data on racial disparities across many areas of society – from policing and health to education and social welfare. It is commonly believed that the biggest obstacle to meaningful change is our inability to recognize our own racial prejudices. The prevalence of unconscious racism or “implicit bias” has been well documented by American social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt (in her seminal book, Biased) and others. Some have responded by taking steps to make the implicit explicit through education generally, and diversity and anti-racism training in particular. Governments and corporations have invested in programs to teach employees about bias and stereotypes, hoping that raising consciousness will change attitudes, assumptions, and behaviour. But the evidence is emerging that this strategy is not effective in producing lasting change, as recently reported in a meta-analysis of close to 1,000 studies of anti-bias interventions. Efforts to reduce bias through education and training may simply not work because it is impossible to change people’s ingrained mindsets and emotions, at least in the short term. A more promising avenue to consider is the social context in which people operate when they interact with others. Implicit in diversity training is the idea that racism is fuelled mainly by what people know and think, but what matters more is what people say and how they behave in the presence of others. Outward expressions of racism are governed in large part by collective social norms about acceptable behaviour. The term “norms” sometimes gets mentioned in the context of problematic content on social media, but what has yet to receive any serious attention is the concept of “social norms” as a fundamental aspect of society that contributes to the systemic nature of racism and where we might focus to address the problem. Social norms are widely held expectations about what is, and is not, acceptable to say and do in particular situations. What is distinctive about such norms is that they are not defined by what people think is important to them personally, but by what they see as the social expectations of others whose opinions matter to them. As such, norms exert a powerful influence on how people act in public and social situations, quite apart from what they may think or feel inside. These norms are typically well entrenched but do change over time. The Holocaust led many people to decide it was no longer acceptable to articulate anti-Jewish stereotypes. The growing awareness of LGBTQ individuals in society and the legislative endorsement of same-sex marriage both improved attitudes and also made it no longer socially acceptable to trade in homophobic slurs. Many people may still harbour negative views about Jews and LGBTQ people, but most now understand it is no longer okay to express them. Sometimes social norms change as a result of intentional efforts. Arguably the most striking example is the successful campaign to change norms around tobacco use in public. Just over a generation ago, smoking in public was common, even cool. Today, the behaviour has become effectively “denormalized” as inconsiderate and self-defeating, even as a significant proportion of the population continues to smoke in private. Regulatory measures that restrict smoking in public settings are also important, but it is the norms more than the laws that govern behaviour. By contrast, consider jaywalking, which is also legally forbidden but widely socially accepted. Social norms play a key role in the dynamics of racism and prejudice because they establish the boundaries around which people act toward those they see as “other.” While internal attitudes and stereotypes are stubbornly resistant to short-term change, action and speech are more amenable to influence and normative pressures. This means that focusing on social norms can be an effective strategy for addressing racism in a meaningful way – especially if the collective norms against intolerance and discrimination are strengthening, which now appears to be happening. Evidence for this can be found in the recent public condemnation of wearing “blackface” in costume, which in a different era was considered by many to be harmless party attire. There is nothing new about the concept of social norms, which social scientists have studied in academic settings and applied to public health challenges in developing countries. What has been missing is the practical application of this science to important societal problems like racism, as well as other pressing challenges such as promoting physical distancing during a pandemic. The essential starting point is to first properly define and measure specific social norms about race-related actions and speech in order to determine their breadth and strength across the population ( a type of research our Institute now plans to undertake ). Such information can then point to where interventions might be directed – to reinforce “positive norms” that are currently prevalent in society (no wearing of blackface) and de-normalizing “negative norms” (e.g., telling jokes that demean the “other”). This might take the form of public awareness campaigns (as was done to de-normalize public smoking) or employee-directed programs. Government and corporate leaders might be effective communicators of appropriate normative behaviour, to the extent they are credible and can exert influence over relevant audiences (which research might confirm). Today in Canada, our understanding of the current reality of racial injustice is at odds with our stated aspirations of justice and inclusion. This tension provides us with a valuable opportunity to create a more just society by developing new strategies that effectively apply normative pressures on each other to do a better job of treating each other as we ourselves expect to be treated.

The doctrine of racism asserts that blood determines national-ethnic identity. Within a racist framework, the value of a human being is not determined by his or her individuality, but instead by membership in a so-called "racial collective nation." Many intellectuals, including scientists, have lent pseudoscientific support to racist thinking. Nineteenth century racist thinkers, such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, exerted a significant influence on many in Adolf Hitler\\\'s generation. Racism, including racial antisemitism (prejudice against or hatred of Jews based on false biological theories), was always an integral part of German National Socialism (Nazism). Photo An antisemitic illustration from a Nazi film strip. The caption, translated from German, states: "As an alien race Jews had no civil rights in the middle ages. They had to reside in a restricted section of town, in a ghetto." Place and date uncertain. Credits: US Holocaust Memorial Museum The Nazis perceived all of human history as the history of a biologically determined struggle among people of different races. The Nazis held that political movements such as Marxism, communism, pacifism, and internationalism were anti-nationalist and reflected a dangerous, racially based Jewish intellectualism. In 1931, the SS ( Schutzstaffel ; the elite guard of the Nazi state) established a Race and Settlement Office to conduct race "research" and to determine the suitability of potential spouses for members of the SS. After the Nazis came to power, they passed the Nuremberg Race Laws in 1935, which codified a supposedly biological definition of Jewishness. ID Card The elder of two daughters born to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, Helene was raised as a Catholic in Vienna. Her father died in action during World War I when Helene was just 5 years old, and her mother remarried when Helene was 15. Known affectionately as Helly, Helene loved to swim and go to the opera. After finishing her secondary education she entered law school. 1933-39: At 19 Helene first showed signs of mental illness. Her condition worsened during 1934, and by 1935 she had to give up her law studies and her job as a legal secretary. After losing her trusted fox terrier, Lydi, she suffered a major breakdown. She was diagnosed as schizophrenic, and was placed in Vienna\\\'s Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital. Two years later, in March 1938, the Germans annexed Austria to Germany. 1940: Helene was confined in Steinhof and was not allowed home even though her condition had improved. Her parents were led to believe that she would soon be released. Instead, Helene\\\'s mother was informed in August that Helene had been transferred to a hospital in Niedernhart, just across the border in Bavaria. In fact, Helene was transferred to a converted prison in Brandenburg, Germany, where she was undressed, subjected to a physical examination, and then led into a shower room. Helene was one of 9,772 persons gassed that year in the Brandenburg " euthanasia " center. She was officially listed as dying in her room of "acute schizophrenic excitement." Nazi racists viewed the mentally and physically ill as blemishes upon the genetic landscape of the so-called master race and, when they reproduced, as a biological danger to the purity of the Aryan race. After careful planning and data collection during the last six months of 1939, German physicians began to murder disabled residents of institutions throughout Germany in an operation that they euphemistically called "euthanasia". According to Nazi theories of race, Germans and other northern Europeans were "Aryans," a superior race. During World War II, Nazi physicians conducted bogus medical experiments seeking to identify physical evidence of Aryan superiority and non-Aryan inferiority. Despite killing countless non-Aryan prisoners in the course of these experiments, the Nazis could not find any evidence for their theories of biological racial differences among human beings. Once in power, the Nazis implemented racial laws and policies that deprived Jews, Black people, and Roma (Gypsies) of their rights. During World War II , the Nazi leadership set about what they referred to as an "ethnic housecleaning" in the occupied Eastern territories of Poland and the Soviet Union. This policy included the murder and annihilation of so-called enemy "races," including the genocide of European Jews and the destruction of the leadership of the Slavic peoples. Nazi racism produced murder on an unprecedented scale.

Refers to the unquestioned and unearned set of advantages, entitlements, benefits and choices bestowed on people solely because they are white. Generally white people who experience such privilege do so without being conscious of it. 2. Structural White Privilege : A system of white domination that creates and maintains belief systems that make current racial advantages and disadvantages seem normal. The system includes powerful incentives for maintaining white privilege and its consequences, and powerful negative consequences for trying to interrupt white privilege or reduce its consequences in meaningful ways. The system includes internal and external manifestations at the individual, interpersonal, cultural and institutional levels. The accumulated and interrelated advantages and disadvantages of white privilege that are reflected in racial/ethnic inequities in life-expectancy and other health outcomes, income and wealth, and other outcomes, in part through different access to opportunities and resources. These differences are maintained in part by denying that these advantages and disadvantages exist at the structural, institutional, cultural, interpersonal, and individual levels and by refusing to redress them or eliminate the systems, policies, practices, cultural norms, and other behaviors and assumptions that maintain them. Interpersonal White Privilege : Behavior between people that consciously or unconsciously reflects white superiority or entitlement. Cultural White Privilege : A set of dominant cultural assumptions about what is good, normal or appropriate that reflects Western European white world views and dismisses or demonizes other world views. Institutional White Privilege : Policies, practices and behaviors of institutions—such as schools, banks, non-profits or the Supreme Court—that have the effect of maintaining or increasing accumulated advantages for those groups currently defined as white, and maintaining or increasing disadvantages for those racial or ethnic groups not defined as white. The ability of institutions to survive and thrive even when their policies, practices and behaviors maintain, expand or fail to redress accumulated disadvantages and/or inequitable outcomes for people of color.

2025-04-14 12:26:39,976 [INFO] summary: Several historical events have significantly fueled the development of racist ideologies. One pivotal moment was the transatlantic slave trade, which transported millions of Africans to the Americas, establishing enduring racial hierarchies based on color. The colonization of various regions by European powers also entrenched ideologies of racial superiority, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. 

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, pseudoscientific notions of racial superiority, such as eugenics, gained traction, influencing policies and attitudes toward different races. The era of Jim Crow laws in the United States legally enforced racial segregation and discrimination. Moreover, the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s epitomized racism on a catastrophic scale, with its ideology leading to the Holocaust.

These events, among others, have contributed to deeply ingrained racist ideologies that persist in various forms today. They have been perpetuated by a combination of legal systems, cultural beliefs, and scientific misconceptions that have been institutionalized over centuries.

This module describes a systemic approach to understanding racism and the implications of such an approach in psychology. Systemic approaches emphasize the important roles historical, cultural, legal, political, and economic systems have in reproducing contemporary forms of racism. By engaging this module, students will be able to better understand the implications of a systemic (versus individualistic) approach in psychology for anti-racist research, anti-racist practices, and anti-racist interventions. Distinguish individual and systemic approaches to racism in psychology Understand race as a social construction and its historical and contemporary links to racism Learn about psychological mechanisms related to differences in perceptions of racism Understand the implications of a systemic approach to racism for research and intervention efforts Consider important connections between overlapping identities and oppression Introduction In 2020, Kennedy Mitchum–a recent college graduate–wrote a series of emails to the editors at Merriam-Webster dictionary, asking them to update their online definitions of racism. At the time, the definition–which had not been significantly revised in decades–contained three entries: Racism is “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences reflect an inherent superiority of a particular race” (or, in other words: racial bigotry) Racism is “a doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles”. (Racism as “doctrine” highlights racism as a set of beliefs held by different political systems like Apartheid or groups like White Supremacists) Racism is “racial prejudice or discrimination.” These definitions might be similar to the ways in which you think about racism. Indeed, these definitions are widely used and they frame everyday discussions of the topic. Thinking about racism as a problem among a certain set of biased or prejudiced people can lead us to underestimate the problem of racism. This is because it narrows the focus to individual acts motivated by hate or ignorance and it overlooks more systemic biases. In this module, we will discuss racism as a multifaceted and multi-level concept. Different Understandings of Racism VIDEO In her email to the dictionary editors, Mitchum wrote, “Racism is not only prejudice against a certain race due to the color of a person’s skin, as it states in your dictionary. It is both prejudice combined with social and institutional power. It is a system of advantage based on skin color” (Hauser, 2020). Spurred by the exchange with Mitchum and the Black Lives Matter Protests in the summer of 2020, the editors updated their definition of racism which now has two entries. The first entry maintains the definition of racism as individual beliefs but the second now explicitly emphasizes racism as systemic oppression. This change is consistent with scholarship that defines racism as a system of advantage and disadvantage based on social, historical, and cultural constructions of race and ethnicity (Jones, 1997/1998; Tatum, 1997; Wellman, 1993). Though this view is generally accepted by psychologists now, it has not always been the case. In psychology, the term racism has sometimes been used synonymously with prejudice (biased feelings or affect), stereotyping (biased thoughts and beliefs, or flawed generalizations), discrimination (differential or the absence of equal treatment), and bigotry (intolerance or hatred toward those with differing beliefs) (Adams et al., 2008a; Adams et al., 2008b). This approach reduces racism to its most basic parts at the individual level so that it can more easily be studied in a laboratory. However, it risks minimizing the institutional, systemic, and cultural processes that inform racism. Research suggests that different understandings of racism—as a problem of individual bias versus a structurally embedded force—are not randomly distributed across people. In the United States, understanding of racism as individual bias is especially pronounced among White Americans (Blauner, 2019; Carter & Murphy, 2015; Sommers & Norton, 2006). For example, Figure 1 (left side) shows the results of polls (Pew Research Center, 2016) that generally find that White Americans are far more likely than Black Americans to define the problem of racism narrowly as discrimination “based on the prejudice of individuals.” Conversely, Black Americans are more likely than White Americans to define the problem of racism more broadly as discrimination “built into laws and institutions.” Beyond differences in the definition of racism, researchers have also noted group differences in perceptions of the role that racism plays in the modern world. Consider the results of another survey that also appear in Figure 1 (right side). Across several social issues, the percentage of participants who believe that racism impacts a wide range of social problems is much lower among White American than among Black American respondents. Figure 1. [Image: Pew Research Center, tinyurl.com/2twte78j, All Rights Reserved.] Systemic Racism VIDEO Systemic approaches to racism emphasize the particular roles that different societal factors—historical, cultural, legal, political, and economic—have played in organizing who is at the top or bottom of a society’s racial hierarchy (Salter et al., 2018) There are a few key ideas that are important to keep in mind for understanding racism as systemic. First, ‘race’ itself, is a social construct . Racial categories are arbitrary in that there is not substantial scientific evidence supporting a clear biological division of ‘races.’ Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why there are four or five common categories, but not 3, 29, or 101? Even though we treat racial categories as if they are true biological distinctions, they are not. Human beings share 99.9% of their genetic makeup (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2018). Most people have physical characteristics or phenotypes that could be associated with more than one racial group. In fact, there are no traits that are only present in one population or ‘race’. There are many expressions of traits found within and across different racial groups (see the images in Figure 2, for example). To say that race is an arbitrary social construct does not mean, however, that peoples’ race-based experiences are not real. Figure 2. [Images in clockwise order: Graham Crumb, https://tinyurl.com/7nwd3pvy, CC BY SA 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/4npnmepz; Ian Beatty, https://tinyurl.com/yc65txse, CC BY SA 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/4npnmepz; Erik Jacobs, https://tinyurl.com/2p8n47hh, CC BY 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/39uaces5; Abolfazl Eslami, https://tinyurl.com/5n6k4ftj, https://tinyurl.com/mrb5u7zv] Second, racial categories were developed with intentions that have fluctuated over time. Racial categorizations have played a key role in dictating which people are marginalized . For example, upon their arrival in the British colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish Catholic immigrants were initially racialized as non-White, working and living alongside free and enslaved Black people (Ignatiev, 2012; Garner, 2007). As Celts, the Irish were considered a less-developed, uncivilized race relative to Anglo-Saxons and faced wide-spread discrimination in this context. However, with a rising population of enslaved Africans and a need to easily distinguish enslaved from free laborers, it became useful to expand the definition of whiteness (Garner, 2007). In the United States, actively defining and redefining who could be considered racially ‘White’ (and free) fortified the racial hierarchy and ultimately cemented enslaved status as tied to Blackness. Modern ideas about race, in the Western world, have their foundations in histories of European imperialism and colonialism. European settlers came into (often violent) contact with communities that they deemed different in appearance and customs. Missionaries, slavers, and explorers commonly described darker-skinned “others” as uncivilized, barbaric, and otherwise culturally deficient in comparison to their European compatriots. The oppression of darker-skinned groups was often based on the assumed superiority of European language, intelligence, morality, beauty, and culture. Competitive pursuit of wealth among European nations accelerated the exploitation, enslavement, and genocide of non-European peoples across the globe (Guthrie, 2004). This process of deeming one’s own group as superior and another group as inferior to motivate and justify violence and colonization is not unique to European contexts, but its duration, extent, and lasting implications make it one of the most staggering examples. Third, there are instances where the historical legacy of racism continues to bear racist consequences today. Even when laws may have changed, traces of historical racism still remain. For example, the patterns of racially segregated housing in most major US cities that we see today map onto governmental policies that emerged in the 1910s and 20s to restrict where African Americans could live and buy homes (Rothstein, 2017). In South Africa, Apartheid (1940s-1990s) systematically denied non-White people access to most forms of capital, guaranteeing that South Africa would be controlled politically, socially, and economically by the nation’s minority White population. Despite the repeal of Apartheid laws and subsequent democratic elections, South African society still struggles with race-based inequalities in wealth, education, and health (National Research Council Panel on Race, Ethnicity, and Health in Later Life, 2004; WIDER & Oosthuizen, 2019). Bridging the Divide: Psychological Research on Perceiving and Denying Racism We have noted that people see racism in different lights. How should we understand such differences in perception of racism? Which psychological factors predict perceptions or denial of racism? Before we discuss a few key factors, we want to point out a tendency of people to focus explanations on groups we think do not fit a perceived norm (Hegarty & Pratto, 2001). Take for example, the caption of Figure 3 from a Pew Research Center report (2020) on views of racial progress in the United States. The caption, “Growing share of Black and Hispanic adults say the country hasn’t made enough progress on racial equality” follows a common tendency to explain differences in views as if it is the minoritized group that deviates from an unspoken norm. Yes, when you examine the data, there are increases between 2019 and 2020 in the number of Black and Hispanic adults who say the United States has not gone far enough in giving equal rights to Black Americans. However, the data show that the graph could also be titled, ‘White views that America’s racial progress has been just about right, remain stagnant’. This tendency to locate the source of group differences in racial “otherness” is, itself, a manifestation of racism of a sort that Thomas Teo (2010) has referred to as epistemological violence . Figure 3. [Image: Pew Research Center, tinyurl.com/4w9sxuwv, All Rights Reserved.] To avoid this, social psychologists suggest that we “turn the analytic lens” (Adams & Salter, 2007) and consider the flip side of the same coin. In this case, we should consider the topic from the standpoint of marginalized groups. The statistic that requires further explanation is the widespread belief that U.S. society has already done enough to attain racial equality. Claims about equality are not consistent with statistical evidence, which documents racial inequalities in education, employment, health, and income (e.g., American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Educational Disparities, 2012; U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). Instead, beliefs about racial equality reflect psychological processes that can facilitate underreporting of the extent of racism in US society. So, what are those psychological processes? Research has revealed two mechanisms through which under-reporting and denial of systemic racism tend to occur. The first—called “defensive motivations” — focuses on how acknowledging racism or other forms of oppression can pose a threat to one’s identity or worldview. The second—known as “foundations of knowledge”—focuses on the cultural information that forms people’s judgments. Defensive Motivations For an advantaged person to admit that racism is prominent in one’s society, they must acknowledge that, ultimately, they receive advantages from an illegitimate system (Jost, Banaji & Nosek, 2004; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). This acknowledgment can threaten one’s sense of personal self-worth or the worth of the group to which the person belongs, known as collective self-worth (O’Brien & Major, 2005). When one’s group is implicated by historical or contemporary wrong-doing, members of that group are motivated to deny that wrong-doing is ongoing, significant, or pervasive in order to maintain a positive view of one’s social group (e.g., Branscombe et al., 1999). For example, when researchers boosted White research participants’ sense of self-worth with positive self-statements, they were then more likely to perceive systemic racism than did participants in a control condition (Unzueta & Lowery, 2008; Adams, Tormala, & O’Brien, 2006). Outside of the U.S. context, researchers have also found that, after completing a self-affirmation task, Israeli participants were more willing to acknowledge the victimization of Palestinians and the Israeli participation in that victimization (Čehajić-Clancy et al., 2011). Opposition to acknowledging the extent to which racism operates in society can sometimes take the form of neutral claims on racism-relevant issues. For example, color-blind race ideology —the idea that people “do not see race”—can seem enlightened but, in practice, primarily serves the purpose of not “seeing” racism. Color-blind racial frames downplay the significance of ethnic and racial identity in peoples’ lived experiences and ignore the role of systemic oppression in impacting opportunities (e.g., Neville et al., 2013 ). Augoustinos and colleagues (2005) found that White Australians often used this principle to justify their opposition to anti-racism initiatives that would benefit Aboriginal people ( Augoustinos, Tuffin, & Every, 2005 ; see also Tuffin, 2008 ). Notably, they would dismiss the need for race-conscious policies that would address historical discrimination by suggesting that all people should be treated equally (and so Aboriginal people should not be given something “extra”), that people should be treated as individuals (and so Aboriginal people should not be treated as a group), and that White people have advanced through merit (thereby ignoring historically accumulated advantages). Foundations of Knowledge Beyond defensive motivations, there is another category of explanations for the tendency to minimize or deny racism. This category concerns the cultural knowledge that informs people’s judgments. A person’s cultural frame might lead to various conclusions about racism. Imagine, for example, an officer deciding to detain a person at the U.S.-Mexico border. Using a “racism as individual prejudice” framework, one might look toward features of the officer (i.e., how they feel about Mexicans) and conclude that without evidence of personal racial bias, the detention was simply the case of an officer applying the law in race-neutral fashion. In contrast, using a more systemic definition of racism, one might see the resulting detention as racially biased, regardless of the personal inclinations of an individual officer, because of the unequal and disparate impact of the policy itself. Consistent with this, researchers have found endorsements for harsher treatment of undocumented Mexican immigrants than undocumented Canadian immigrants, especially among White participants who equated being a true American with ethnocentric cultural values (e.g., being able to speak English without a “foreign” accent) (Mukherjee et al., 2013). Discretionary institutional policies that rely on ethno-racial profiling and mistreatment are forms of structural racism and everyday violence (Alexander, 2011). Another kind of cultural knowledge that facilitates or inhibits awareness of racism is collective memory about the role of past racism. Research on the Marley Hypothesis reveals that perceptions of racism are positively related to accurate historical knowledge (Bonam et al., 2019; Nelson, Adams, & Salter, 2013). In these studies, Black and White participants completed a “Black history” quiz that asked about historical events such as the U.S. government deliberately exposing black members of the military to syphilis, or hiding microphones in the hotel rooms of Civil Rights leaders. In the original study (Nelson et al., 2013) and in the replication (Bonam et al., 2019), White Americans scored lower on the measure of historical accuracy than did the Black Americans. Moreover, differences in knowledge of past racism helped explain Black and White differences in perception of present racism in U.S. society. Kurtiş and colleagues (2017) applied a similar research approach in Turkish contexts to further understand the relationship between critical historical knowledge about minority populations and policy support. They found that participants who demonstrated more accurate knowledge about officially silenced incidents of historical violence regarding minorities expressed greater support for protection of minority rights (Kurtiş, Soylu-Yalçınkaya, & Adams, 2017). Collective memory about racism is not only an individual-level phenomenon. What we know about historical events is embodied in cultural tools like textbooks, school curricula, government-sanctioned holidays, and memorials. Official government accounts of history tend to sanitize or silence the more negative or racist stories in order to maintain a positive view of a country’s past and present. For example, Moore (2020) analyzed Australian history textbooks from 1950-2010. She was interested in the idea of interest-convergence . Interest convergence suggests that White (or dominant group) engagement in racial progress emerges when it aligns with their own interests. Moore (2020) discovered that earlier textbooks were ‘loud and proud’ when highlighting supposed deficiencies in Aboriginal people and White exceptionalism. However, over time they were reframed in more subtle terms. For example, early Aboriginal sea voyages are sometimes dismissed as short, easy, and as employing primitive boats. Similarly, descriptions of hunting and gathering are framed to suggest that Aboriginal communities operated by survival instinct rather than making sophisticated, intentional, and cooperative community decisions. These explanations of Aboriginal culture are less overtly racist, but continue to set up the idea that White settlers in Australia brought more sophisticated technology, the rule of law, and other forms of “civilization.” Moore (2020) suggests that changes from overtly racist textbook narratives to more subtle forms are designed to affirm White racial progressiveness while still upholding White Supremacy. Consistent with these findings, research on how high schools in the U.S. discuss Black history revealed differences between predominantly Black and predominantly White schools (Salter & Adams, 2016). The researchers observed that predominantly White schools were more likely to present a version of Black history that promotes multicultural tolerance and diversity. Another notable strategy was to highlight individual Black American achievement—inventors, intellectuals, and Civil Rights heroes—while minimizing discussion of the historical barriers that these people faced. By contrast, predominantly Black schools were more likely to position Black history as accounts of the ongoing legacy of systemic exploitation and violent oppression. Cultural products, such as school curricula and textbooks, are not necessarily neutral accounts of what factually happened in the past; they reflect biases carried forward from the past and biases cultivated in the present. Psychological studies have also highlighted the consequences of being exposed to different foundations of knowledge. In the same line of research described above, Salter and Adams (2016) randomly assigned White American university students to view two distinct representations of Black History Month: those from predominantly White schools or those from predominantly Black schools. Their results indicate that exposure to representations of history from predominantly Black schools (which were more likely to contain narratives of historical racism) led to greater perceptions of racism and support for antiracist policies. Similarly, in a study by Bonam and colleagues (2019), White American participants listened to a clip of historian Richard Rothstein on NPR’s Fresh Air program discussing the federal government’s role in creating Black ghettos and the ongoing legacy of systemic racism in housing. The researchers found that listening to the clip increased critical history knowledge (in comparison to a control condition), increased beliefs about the government’s active role in creating Black ghettos, and, in turn, increased perceptions of systemic racism. Together, studies in this research program suggest how cultural representations of the past—what we might refer to as collective memory—matter for interpretation of the present. These studies also illuminate different sources of knowledge as important components for perceiving systemic racism. People who engage with representations of history that obscure past racism not only indicate a smaller role for racism as an explanation for contemporary events, but also express less support for reparative policies such as affirmative action than do people who engage with representations that acknowledge past racism. Before we move to the final section of the module, we would like you to pause and consider the links between the two mechanisms described in this section: motivation to view one’s self positively and information-based judgments of racism. Though we have presented them separately, they are related to each other. For example, Mukherjee and colleagues (2017) asked participants in India to rate historical events that either glorified India or acknowledged wrongdoing against marginalized groups. The nation-glorifying events were rated as more relevant and more important for the study of Indian history. Notably, exposure to glorifying themes about collective achievements in India produced higher national identification and exposure to critical narratives about collective wrongdoing decreased national identification. Thus, the two processes affect one another: certain information boosted the desire to view one’s group favorably and viewing one’s group favorably predicted the types of information a person prefers. Important to our discussion, exposure to critical narratives produced greater perceptions of injustice in India. By contrast, exposure to themes that glorified India lowered perceptions of injustice. Regardless of individual beliefs and biases, mainstream cultural tools influence people to approach the topic of racial justice in ways that serve national and dominant group interests. Implications for Action against Racism A major goal of this module has been to articulate a systemic approach to understanding racism. We end the module by discussing the implications of this approach for action against racism. We break our discussion into three distinct sections: 1) anti-racist research, 2) anti-racist practices and interventions, and 3) intersectional considerations. Anti-Racist Research As discussed above, standard psychological accounts of racism often suggest that it is a problem of biased individuals. This individualistic approach to racism is evident in research on the topic. Racism research often examines individual personality traits such as authoritarian personality or social justice orientation (see Noba’s Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping ). This approach to understanding racism leads to the idea that counteracting racism consists of measuring and altering personal qualities such as prejudice. As an example, one trend has involved the development of measures to identify people with implicit racist dispositions (e.g., Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). Another research trend has been to develop strategies that people might use to change their racist dispositions (Devine, Brodish, & Vance, 2005; Monteith, Ashburn-Nardo, Voils, & Czopp, 2002; Sassenberg & Moskowitz, 2005). Although research on individual factors in racism can reveal important insights, it may miss others. In contrast to an exclusive focus on individual dispositions, a systemic approach locates the roots of racism in social and cultural factors. This approach calls for research to examine the role that institutions, norms, laws, and policies play in racism. Table 1 lists examples of both individual and systemic questions about racism that researchers might ask. The systemic questions emphasize an attention to the interplay between individual and systemic oppression (see Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbett, 1998; Oakes, Haslam, & Turner, 1994). Addressing these questions requires the use of unique theoretical perspectives and empirical techniques that are relatively rare in psychological research (e.g., discourse analysis, decolonial approaches, critical race theory frameworks). These approaches have the potential to yield new insights because they are more likely to include the experiences and perspectives of racially marginalized people. Table 1. Anti-Racist Intervention Beyond its implications for research, a systemic approach to racism also suggests a shift in the emphasis of anti-racist interventions. Psychologists have typically framed the fight against racism as reducing individual prejudice or changing racist attitudes, and have designed effective programs to address this goal. Standard approaches to prejudice reduction seem to imply that the formerly racist individual, equipped with new attitudes, will now be anti-racist. In addition, this strategy implies that racially marginalized groups should accept a reduction of prejudice as a substitute for challenging the legacy of historical violence and the enduring, unjust status quo. A systemic approach to anti-racism, by contrast, proposes to change the societal structures that foster racist tendencies (Karpinski & Hilton, 2001). This direction suggests that people might better control automatic racist tendencies by disengaging from experiences that promote racism and, instead, cultivate experiences that reinforce anti-racist tendencies. For example, interventions that increase engagement with diversity may lead participants to seek out diverse social communities or conversations that can promote non-racist attitudes (see Gurin et al., 2008). The systemic approach to addressing racism also calls for dismantling racist structures that continue to cause harm, above and beyond the prejudices of any individual person. This includes challenging popular accounts of history; namely, progress narratives that promote the idea that society was once racist but now has overcome racism (Richeson, 2020). Such challenges emphasize: understanding the experiences of people who belong to historically marginalized groups exposing and reforming racist laws and institutional policies including alternative narratives of history that include the voices and understandings of marginalized communities raising awareness of privilege among members of dominant groups One example of work in this direction involves challenging traditional notions of merit (Croizet, 2008). Specifically, intelligence tests, college entrance exams, and other assessments of “ability” or “aptitude” have been used to discriminate against people of color. Although these types of tests often yield differences in scores between members of various racial groups, these differences do not suggest that members of dominant groups are smarter or have more potential. Instead, they reflect inequalities in test familiarity, test preparation and support, educational support, and similar factors. Other examples of challenging common attitudes involve challenging conceptions of fairness (Jones, 1998; Smith & Crosby, 2008), national identity (Gurin et al., 2008), and accounts of history (Sears, 2008; Yellow Bird, 2004). Intersectional Considerations One of the complicating factors in successfully addressing racism is intersectionality . Rooted in Black feminist scholarship and critical race theory, intersectionality is the idea that people’s lived experience of oppression is based on more than a single identity. Intersectional analyses consider the oppression that arises out of the combination of various forms of discrimination which produces something distinctive from any one form of discrimination alone. One of the earliest recorded accounts of intersectionality dates back to the 1851 Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio where a former slave, –Sojourner Truth– delivered her famous “Ain’t I a woman?” speech. In it, she provided an account of Black women born into slavery at the intersections of race and gender. In the 1990s, Kimberlé Crenshaw popularized the term intersectionality to describe the exclusion of Black women from feminist discourse (which equated women with White) and conversations about racism (which equated Black with men). Intersectionality situates experience within a complex web of power relations including dimensions such as race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, class, dis/ability, and sexuality (Anthias & Yuval-Davis, 1983; Crenshaw, 1989; Collins & Bilge, 2020 ; hooks, 2000; Hurtado, 1998). Attention to intersectionality can help us move beyond dichotomous formulations (e.g. us–them, oppressor–oppressed) to better appreciate the personal and cultural experiences that structure our everyday lives in distinct yet interrelated ways (Grewal & Kaplan, 2001). Intersectional analyses elevate the often-ignored experiences of people in marginalized identity positions ( Matsuda, 1 9 87 ). Accordingly, a primary contribution of intersectional analyses is to rethink standard accounts of knowledge (Kurtiş & Adams, 2016) and reimagine society from the perspective of those in marginalized positions. Conclusion Psychology has played a pivotal role in the struggle against racism since decades. Scholars have produced nuanced accounts about the dynamics of individual prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Yet, persisting inequalities and racism reveal that efforts at research, intervention, and education remain incomplete. In this module, we have proposed that one direction for action is a systemic approach to racism. From this perspective, racism is not an issue of biased individuals, but instead, a historically rooted and enduring cultural pattern embedded in everyday laws, policies, and social attitudes that can cause harm for people from oppressed groups. Racism can also create advantages for people from dominant groups, even if they are unaware of these benefits or have no personal intention to discriminate. Accordingly, anti-racist efforts require greater attention to multiple and intersecting systems of oppression. These efforts compel us to pay attention to both how environmental patterns of racism shape individual experience, but also processes by which even good-intentioned individuals can unknowingly reproduce systems of racism. Vocabulary Automatic Automatic biases are unintended, immediate, and irresistible. Aversive racism Aversive racism is unexamined racial bias that the person does not intend and would reject, but that avoids inter-racial contact. Blatant biases Blatant biases are conscious beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing to admit, are mostly hostile, and openly favor their own group. Discrimination Discrimination is behavior that advantages or disadvantages people merely based on their group membership. Implicit Association Test Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures relatively automatic biases that favor own group relative to other groups. Model minority A minority group whose members are perceived as achieving a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average. Prejudice Prejudice is an evaluation or emotion toward people merely based on their group membership. Right-wing authoritarianism Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) focuses on value conflicts but endorses respect for obedience and authority in the service of group conformity. Self-categorization theory Self-categorization theory develops social identity theory’s point that people categorize themselves, along with each other into groups, favoring their own group. Social dominance orientation Social dominance orientation (SDO) describes a belief that group hierarchies are inevitable in all societies and even good, to maintain order and stability. Social identity theory Social identity theory notes that people categorize each other into groups, favoring their own group. Stereotype Content Model Stereotype Content Model shows that social groups are viewed according to their perceived warmth and competence. Stereotypes Stereotype is a belief that characterizes people based merely on their group membership. Subtle biases Subtle biases are automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent, but real in their consequences. References Adams, G., & Salter, P. S. (2007).

Four in five Black adults say they see racist or racially insensitive depictions of their race in the news either often or sometimes, according to the Pew Research Center. READ MORE: Bringing historical Black newspapers into the digital age, students discover their past Three years after George Floyd’s killing triggered a racial reckoning in the news media, Pew took its first broad-based look at Black attitudes toward the media with a survey of nearly 5,000 Black adults this past winter and follow-up focus groups. The survey found 63% of respondents saying news about Black people is often more negative than it is toward other racial or ethnic groups, with 28% saying it is about equal. “It’s not surprising at all,” said Charles Whitaker , dean of the Medill journalism school at Northwestern University. “We’ve known both anecdotally, and through my personal experience with the Black press, that Blacks have long been dissatisfied with their coverage. “There’s a feeling that Black Americans are often depicted as perpetrators or victims of crime, and there are no nuances in the coverage,” Whitaker said. That attitude is reflected in the Pew study’s finding that 57% of respondents say the media only covers certain segments of Black communities, compared to 9% who say that a wide variety is depicted. “They should put a lot more effort into providing context,” said Richard Prince, a columnist for the Journal-isms newsletter , which covers diversity issues. “They should realize that Blacks and other people of color want to be portrayed as having the same concerns as everybody else, in addition to hearing news about African American concerns.” Advertising actually does a much better job of showing Black people in situations common to everybody, raising families or deciding where to go for dinner, he said. WATCH: How diversity in media and entertainment affects young people Prince said he’s frequently heard concerns about Black crime victims being treated like suspects in news coverage, down to the use of police mug shots as illustrations. He recently convened a journalist’s roundtable to discuss the lingering, notorious issue of five Black men who were exonerated after being accused of attacking a white jogger in New York’s Central Park in the 1980s. During a time of sharp partisan differences, the study found virtually no difference in attitudes toward news coverage between Black Democrats and Republicans, said Katerina Eva Matsa, director of news and information research at Pew. For example, 46% of Republicans and 44% of Democrats say that news coverage largely stereotyped Black people, Pew said. Negative attitudes toward the press tended to increase with income and education levels, Matsa said. While 57% of those in lower income levels said news coverage about Black people was more negative than it was about other groups. That number jumped to 75% of wealthier respondents, the study found. A large majority of those surveyed, young and old, expressed little confidence that things would improve much in their lifetime. While 40% of survey participants said it was important to see Black journalists report on issues about race and racial inequality, the race of journalists wasn’t that important about general news. Prince said it’s important for journalists to know history; he wrote on Monday about the idea of a government shutdown was raised in 1879 when former Confederates in Congress wanted to deny money to protect Black people at the polls, and how the filibuster started to prevent civil rights legislation. READ MORE: Latinos vastly underrepresented in media, new report finds At Northwestern, professors are trying to teach students of the importance of having a broader sense of the communities that they’re covering, Whitaker said. Medill is also a hub for solutions journalism, which emphasizes coverage of people trying to solve societal problems. “We’re trying to get away from parachute journalism,” he said. Prince said there was notable progress, post-Floyd, in the hiring of Black journalists into leadership roles in the media. Unfortunately, the news industry continues to contract while social media increases in importance, he said. “We’re integrating an industry that’s shrinking,” he said.

His work includes research on the impacts of police-involved killings—like that of George Floyd—on the educational and psychological well-being of children and on the political engagement of underserved communities . Amid recent debate over the role of media in fueling racial injustice, Ang focused his research lens on a century-old trigger of white-supremacist violence, a brutally racist movie called The Birth of a Nation. He measured the wave of lynchings, race riots, and Ku Klux Klan recruitment that occurred in counties where the movie was shown during a five-year national roadshow from 1915 to 1919. He found that the film incited significant increases in racial violence—roadshow counties were five times more likely to have a lynching or race riot and three times more likely to have a Klan chapter after the movie arrived—and these effects persist in those areas even today. Ang thought that studying the dangerous influence of that hugely successful film could help people understand and combat current hate crimes and violence. His working paper , “The Birth of a Nation: Media and Racial Hate,” is under revision for the American Economic Review. Ang answers questions about what he learned. Q: Why would a silent movie that looks almost like caricature today still have relevance for those who think about political violence in the 21 st century? What made you want to study it? First, I would say that The Birth of a Nation was a massive cultural landmark in American history. It was the first movie ever screened at the White House and is widely credited with the birth of Hollywood as we know it. It remains one of the highest grossing movies of all time and has been seen by an estimated 200 million people. So, I do think that there is a lot of value even as a historical exercise, to see the impact of this movie on the rise of the Klan a hundred years ago. That said, there’s this fundamental question that we’re grappling with today, which is what role has media played in the rise of hate crimes and mass violence in recent years. And the issue is that today’s media is both highly segmented and diffuse. There’s so much choice that it becomes hard to say whether media is causing certain behaviors or simply reflecting the preferences of its audience. At the same time, media is so diffuse that for some of these big events—like former President Trump’s tweets or speeches—it’s hard to find anyone who hasn’t heard what he said or tweeted, which is what we need to be able to estimate media’s impact. By going back in time, to the release of America’s first blockbuster, it’s much easier to isolate these causal effects because there were far fewer sources of competing media. The Birth of a Nation was the big movie for several years and while everyone wanted to see it, not everyone could. And even people who were able to watch the film could only do so during limited windows, when the movie visited their town. So it’s a much cleaner setting for answering this question about media’s impact on racial prejudice. Q: You looked specifically at the counties where the movie was shown across the country from 1915 to 1919. How did you find that data? Was this taking place just in the South or nationwide? To figure out where the movie was shown, I searched digitized historical newspapers for theater advertisements for the film. What I found was that the movie wasn’t just shown in the South or areas that you might think were the most racist. Rather, the roadshow traveled all over the country—something like 600 plus counties in every state except for Kansas, where it was banned by the governor until the mid-1920s. Newspaper estimates at the time suggest that nearly 50 percent of adults saw the film in Boston, Baltimore, and New Orleans. Obviously, those cities are located in very different areas, and even then they had very different political leanings. But once the movie came to town, people (predominantly white people) turned out in droves. Something like 10 million people saw the movie in the first two years. To put that in perspective, the total U.S. adult population at the time was something like 60 million people. Q: Your conclusions start with the near term, during and soon after the film was shown. What differences did you document in lynchings and race riots in counties where the move was screened compared with those where it was not shown? With the movie advertisement data, we know exactly the date the film arrived in a given county. And what you see is a big spike in lynchings and race riots in the month of the film’s arrival. Counties were about five times more likely experience a lynching or riot during that month. These are pretty extreme and rare events, so you could imagine that the film also triggered other more common forms of racial violence or discrimination. Unfortunately, the historical data on those outcomes is just not comprehensive enough for me to measure those effects. Q: You also looked at the impact in recruitment for the Ku Klux Klan. Many of us think of the KKK as an outgrowth of Reconstruction right after the Civil War. But you attribute its rebirth in the 1920s to the movie. How did you track that? It’s a crazy story. The original KKK, the one founded during Reconstruction and depicted in the film, was actually disbanded by the late 1800s. There was no KKK in existence when the movie premiered in early 1915. Then about six months later, the Klan was revived by a Methodist preacher named William Simmons. What’s incredible is that a lot of the practices of the revived KKK were essentially inventions of the film. The original Klan didn’t wear white hooded robes as uniforms. They also didn’t burn crosses. But The Birth of a Nation presented both practices as traditions of original Klan. Then when Simmons revived the group, he burned a cross (the first recorded instance of cross-burning in the U.S.) and had everyone wear these white robes. Both practices are synonymous with the Klan, even today. So historians have long credited the movie with inspiring the rebirth of the KKK, but I wanted to test this hypothesis and measure how much of the Klan’s support could be attributed to the movie.\'}, {\'title\': \'The Pervasiveness Of Racism And Bias In The Media - Forbes\', \'url\': \'https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2022/02/28/the-pervasiveness-of-racism-and-bias-in-the-media/\', \'content\': \'“The media’s the most powerful entity on earth.

More to make the guilty innocent, and that’s power." getty In the wake of great tragedy, society will come together with community leaders to share ways to support impacted communities. The current times we are living in are marred by clashes and conflict. It seems like with every passing day, there is a new calamity that is dominating the headlines. Rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine have reached a precipice , with Russian forces invading Ukraine. As global news outlets provide the public with hour-by-hour updates about the conflict, many media outlets and journalists are being called out for racialized language in the way that stories are being reported. In one news segment, a senior foreign correspondent for CBS News stated that Ukraine “isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively European…city, where you wouldn’t expect that or hope that it’s going to happen.” In another news segment for BBC news, the former deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine explained that the conflict with Russia and Ukraine was very emotional for him because of the fact that it involved “European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed.” Within the media, there are countless examples of how racialized groups are further marginalized through carefully crafted verbiage. This language makes viewers believe that war and conflict is only for “third-world” and “under-developed” countries where Indigenous and Black people reside. Inequities in the reporting of stories contributes to the oppression that racialized people experience. There are not just innumerable examples of racism in the ways that news is reported. When examining the stories that are deemed as “worthy” of being covered, we see how pervasive racism is. More reports must highlight how African migrants were being turned away while fleeing from Ukraine, but stories like this don’t initially gain as much coverage or traction. There has been a lack of coverage highlighting the conflict between the government of Ethiopia and the forces in the Tigray region. The conflict has persisted since November of 2020 and thousands of people have died while more than 300,000 people are living in famine. In the West African country of Cameroon, there is currently a civil war taking place in the country’s northwest region. The Anglophone crisis has been ongoing since 2016 and has displaced over a million people. It seems that the world only cares about crises when they impact white people. In December of 2021, 23-year-old Lauren Smith-Fields was found dead in her Bridgeport, Connecticut apartment. Smith-Fields’ family was never notified of her death. Smith-Field had been on a Bumble date before she passed away. Smith-Field’s case did not gain national attention until rapper Cardi B posted about the case on her social media account, which helped the story gain national attention. Black women, girls, and femmes who go missing or are found dead are rarely reported on. This lack of visibility when it comes to their stories was the reason why the # SayHerName campaign was birthed. Misogynoir in the media influences whether these stories are even reported on at all. The missing white woman syndrome equates to media coverage on the atrocities that impact white women while actively disregarding and ignoring the harm that Black, Indigenous, Asian, and other non-white people experience. Even when analyzing what we deem as worthy entertainment, the white and Eurocentric lens prevails. A new Netflix documentary called The Tinder Swindler has topped Netflix’s most-watched lists in recent weeks. The documentary centers on the story of a man who called himself Simon Leviev, who made his living tricking women into thinking he was a billionaire, while getting them to give him exorbitant amounts of money. Viewers may feel sympathy for the women featured, who share their stories of being lied to and conned. One can’t help but wonder whether this story would get told if it featured Black women experiencing harm while engaging in online dating. If the lack of initial coverage that Lauren Smith-Field’s story received is any indication, then we know what the answer to that would be. Malcolm X is quoted to have said “the media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that’s power. Because they control the minds of the masses.” Creating a world that is safe, just, and equitable for all requires us to interrogate every system and structure that exists, including our mass media. There is a bias in what gets reported and how the coverage is being reported. Words are powerful and the messages we consume from the media are often overlooked. We must be vigilant about calling out these inequities because of the direct impact that the media has in shaping our perceptions.\'}, {\'title\': \'Unpacking How Media Influences Our Views on Racism\', \'url\': \'https://www.unlv.edu/news/article/unpacking-how-media-influences-our-views-racism\', \'content\': \'It\\\'s in the details left out and the victims who never had their stories told. It exists in the long-held biases, invisible but just under the surface. Structural racism in modern media is pernicious, and resolving it will require honest discussions, a more diverse workforce, and a confrontation of its roots in an ugly and discriminatory history. That was the message from the panelists in the latest installment of " We Need to Talk ," a seven-part series at UNLV exploring what drives racist behavior and how those beliefs permeate society. The series is live-streamed by UNLV TV and moderated by Claytee White, director of the UNLV Oral History Research Center . In "Episode 3: We Need to Talk About Communication," members of the UNLV community and local media discussed how biases affect newsrooms and the communities they cover. The impact of those perceptions can stretch beyond which stories are told, affecting which voices are elevated in media, whether intentional or not. The panelists also discussed efforts to combat those influences and how the media can work to get the story right, from obtaining multiple viewpoints to dedicating themselves to truth-telling. Panelist Nissa Tzun, a UNLV graduate student in the schools of social work and journalism , said biases in popular media have long planted seeds of discriminatory thought. Tzun, whose family moved to Canada from Hong Kong, described how new immigrants often first see depictions of Black people as criminals or victims of police abuse. Such images can send the message to immigrants that Black people or other communities of color should be avoided to keep away from violence, she said. "The root of western media is white supremacy and that\\\'s where implicit bias stems from," Tzun said. "It\\\'s the idea of the racial stereotypes that are repeated, time and time again through the decades, shown on the television of Black people depicting stereotypes that are perpetuated by the white community." Ricardo Torres-Cortez , a reporter at the Las Vegas Sun and Hank Greenspun School of Journalism and Media Studies alumnus, noted that news media organizations, too, have played a role in perpetuating such biases. The language used to depict communities of color in even major news institutions like "The New York Times" was sometimes far from inclusive in the past. "You see some of this racist language, and you\\\'re supposed to depend on these places to educate you. And they just weren\\\'t at the time doing that," he said. In the present, journalists may occasionally struggle with a busy news cycle and lack of resources, requiring them to jump from one story to another, Torres-Cortez said. Such circumstances aren’t ideal to produce the type of in-depth reporting that might reduce racial stigmas or question official narratives. Tzun and producer Oja Vincent co-founded a multimedia documentary project in 2009 to combat this reality. The Forced Trajectory Project provides as a media and advocacy team for those affected by police violence. They have focused specifically on the Las Vegas Valley since 2016. The project features the stories of individuals killed by police, their families and the communities that feel the impact of those deaths. "The fact that their loved one has been killed by an agent of the state really creates numerous barriers to justice for them," Tzun said. Those barriers are amplified in part by the fact that many stories exclude victim and family narratives or simply don\\\'t get told, she added. Ashton Ridley, radio manager at KUNV-FM within the school of journalism, said one of the central ways media can move difficult conversations on race forward is by offering a platform. At KUNV, two shows centered on diversity — one on the student radio side and another on the station\\\'s main radio channel — are in the works. Ridley said he believes radio is a useful method for tackling these issues. “Having that connection with that voice that’s coming through, that just takes it to another level,” he said. “And then you might be opened up to have that conversation with your significant other or somebody that’s close to you.” Ultimately, before a person can begin to target and eliminate the biases they have accumulated over a lifetime, they have to first understand what those biases are, Ridley said. The communication panel included a pre-recorded discussion between White and communication studies professor Emma Frances Bloomfield , who is co-director of the UNLV Public Communication Initiative. Through her work researching climate change denial, Bloomfield has developed strategies for tough conversations among people with fundamental disagreements. These tips from Bloomfield can guide productive conversations with friends and family on structural racism and white supremacy: Enter the conversation like a dialogue. Don\\\'t talk down to the other person or be aggressive. Instead, invite them to join a conversation. Ask questions. Doing so shows you care and offers insight into the other person\\\'s thinking. Find points of common value. This provides a connection on which to base the conversation.< Tell stories. Systemic racism is such a large topic. Stories can make it easier to connect with the topic. "I find that when people discount facts like \\\'climate change is real\\\' or \\\'systemic racism is real\\\' it\\\'s for one of two reasons: One it\\\'s an issue of ignorance and a lack of knowledge," Bloomfield said, "but it can also be because they feel threatened." Asking people questions about their beliefs allows for exploration of why they feel the way they do. These insights can help drive the conversation to resolve differences and open up loved ones to new perspectives. Three panels in the “We Need to Talk” series remain to be aired Oct. 29, Nov. 12, and Nov. 19. All three will air at 5:30 p.m. and are streamed live in partnership with the students of UNLV-TV. The conversations are sponsored by University Libraries and the Greenspun College of Urban Affairs . UNLV Libraries Advisory Board members Sara Mason and Geri Tomich provided additional funding.\'}]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

They establish the boundaries for treating those perceived as \'other\' and govern public expressions of racism. Although personal prejudices and stereotypes may exist, it is social norms that largely determine public behavior, making them crucial points of intervention for addressing racism. By changing social norms, for instance, through public awareness campaigns and education, it is possible to denormalize racist and discriminatory practices, thereby contributing to a reduction in systemic racism.

The era of Jim Crow laws in the United States legally enforced racial segregation and discrimination. Moreover, the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s epitomized racism on a catastrophic scale, with its ideology leading to the Holocaust.\\n\\nThese events, among others, have contributed to deeply ingrained racist ideologies that persist in various forms today.

Psychological theories suggest that biases at the individual level can manifest as prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. These are often rooted in personality traits such as authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and a lack of empathy. Additionally, mechanisms like defensive motivations and cultural knowledge influence how individuals perceive racism. Defensive motivations, for instance, can lead individuals to deny systemic racism to avoid threats to their identity or worldview. Cultural knowledge, or the lack thereof, also impacts one\'s awareness and acknowledgment of racism. For example, a person\'s understanding of historical events related to race can significantly affect their perception of present racism. Overall, while individual psychology contributes to racist attitudes, it interacts with broader systemic, cultural, and historical factors that uphold racism in society."}, {"sub_q": "In what ways do media and propaganda influence racial prejudice?", "answer": "Media and propaganda can significantly influence racial prejudice. Historically, media portrayals, like that of the film \\"The Birth of a Nation,\\" have incited racial violence and contributed to the growth of racist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan. Modern media continues to shape racial attitudes through biased reporting and the reinforcement of stereotypes. News media often depict minorities in negative or stereotypically harmful ways, contributing to public perceptions that align with existing prejudices. Additionally, selective reporting and racialized language in journalism further entrench stereotypes, as seen in the differentiated coverage of crises depending on the race of those affected. These portrayals can condition audiences to hold prejudiced views by consistently associating racial groups with negative characteristics or circumstances. Addressing these biases in media requires honest discussions, diverse representation in newsrooms, and a commitment to comprehensive and fair coverage of all communities.\\"}"}]}]'}, {'agent': 'planner', 'role': 'assistant', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_pourFQo5UiOJ8BPVr0MrZv6Y', 'function': {'arguments': '{"reason":"The decomposed sub-questions have been sufficiently answered, providing a comprehensive view of the multi-faceted influences leading to racism, including societal norms, historical events, individual psychology, and media influence.

Racism is influenced by a complex interplay of factors that operate at multiple levels:

1. **Societal Structures and Norms**: These establish what is considered acceptable behavior and can institutionalize racism by perpetuating discriminatory behaviors and prejudiced attitudes. For instance, entrenched social norms can reinforce systemic racism, but changing these norms through public awareness and education can help reduce it.

2. **Historical Events**: Key events have cemented racist ideologies over time. The transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, and the policies of the Jim Crow era are just a few examples. These events created racial hierarchies and spread pseudoscientific notions of racial superiority that have had lasting impacts.

3. **Individual Psychology**: At an individual level, psychological traits and mechanisms—such as susceptibility to authoritarianism and a lack of cultural knowledge—can foster prejudices and stereotypes. Defensive motivations may lead individuals to deny systemic issues, and personal biases can manifest as discrimination.

4. **Media and Propaganda**: Media representations historically and presently have shaped public perceptions by reinforcing stereotypes or portraying certain racial groups negatively. The impact of biased reporting can entrench prejudices and shape societal attitudes towards different racial groups.

Together, these factors contribute to the perpetuation of racism. Addressing it requires comprehensive strategies tackling societal norms, revising historical narratives, fostering cultural understanding, and ensuring fair media representation.

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”'}, {'title': 'The psychology of American racism and how to work against it', 'url': 'https://www.apa.org/pubs/highlights/spotlight/issue-189', 'content': ''}]"}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

And then, in May, video footage of the horrific murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police ignited a blaze of protest that spread across the United States and also Canada, a country with its own history of colonialism and racism. The depth of the reflection and conversation – public and private – provoked by the protests was unprecedented. For the first time, many of this country’s leaders unequivocally acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in Canada, and reflected the predominant public sentiment. Our own research shows that a significant majority of Canadians now recognize the reality of racial discrimination in this country, especially as it affects people who are Indigenous and Black. Such recognition of racism in our society is a significant milestone, long in coming. Doing something about it becomes the next step, and represents an even greater challenge given how deeply such prejudice is embedded in Canada’s dominant culture and institutions. Evidence of its pervasiveness confronts us both in personal anecdotes and in hard data on racial disparities across many areas of society – from policing and health to education and social welfare. It is commonly believed that the biggest obstacle to meaningful change is our inability to recognize our own racial prejudices. The prevalence of unconscious racism or “implicit bias” has been well documented by American social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt (in her seminal book, Biased) and others. Some have responded by taking steps to make the implicit explicit through education generally, and diversity and anti-racism training in particular. Governments and corporations have invested in programs to teach employees about bias and stereotypes, hoping that raising consciousness will change attitudes, assumptions, and behaviour. But the evidence is emerging that this strategy is not effective in producing lasting change, as recently reported in a meta-analysis of close to 1,000 studies of anti-bias interventions. Efforts to reduce bias through education and training may simply not work because it is impossible to change people’s ingrained mindsets and emotions, at least in the short term. A more promising avenue to consider is the social context in which people operate when they interact with others. Implicit in diversity training is the idea that racism is fuelled mainly by what people know and think, but what matters more is what people say and how they behave in the presence of others. Outward expressions of racism are governed in large part by collective social norms about acceptable behaviour. The term “norms” sometimes gets mentioned in the context of problematic content on social media, but what has yet to receive any serious attention is the concept of “social norms” as a fundamental aspect of society that contributes to the systemic nature of racism and where we might focus to address the problem. Social norms are widely held expectations about what is, and is not, acceptable to say and do in particular situations. What is distinctive about such norms is that they are not defined by what people think is important to them personally, but by what they see as the social expectations of others whose opinions matter to them. As such, norms exert a powerful influence on how people act in public and social situations, quite apart from what they may think or feel inside. These norms are typically well entrenched but do change over time. The Holocaust led many people to decide it was no longer acceptable to articulate anti-Jewish stereotypes. The growing awareness of LGBTQ individuals in society and the legislative endorsement of same-sex marriage both improved attitudes and also made it no longer socially acceptable to trade in homophobic slurs. Many people may still harbour negative views about Jews and LGBTQ people, but most now understand it is no longer okay to express them. Sometimes social norms change as a result of intentional efforts. Arguably the most striking example is the successful campaign to change norms around tobacco use in public. Just over a generation ago, smoking in public was common, even cool. Today, the behaviour has become effectively “denormalized” as inconsiderate and self-defeating, even as a significant proportion of the population continues to smoke in private. Regulatory measures that restrict smoking in public settings are also important, but it is the norms more than the laws that govern behaviour. By contrast, consider jaywalking, which is also legally forbidden but widely socially accepted. Social norms play a key role in the dynamics of racism and prejudice because they establish the boundaries around which people act toward those they see as “other.” While internal attitudes and stereotypes are stubbornly resistant to short-term change, action and speech are more amenable to influence and normative pressures. This means that focusing on social norms can be an effective strategy for addressing racism in a meaningful way – especially if the collective norms against intolerance and discrimination are strengthening, which now appears to be happening. Evidence for this can be found in the recent public condemnation of wearing “blackface” in costume, which in a different era was considered by many to be harmless party attire. There is nothing new about the concept of social norms, which social scientists have studied in academic settings and applied to public health challenges in developing countries. What has been missing is the practical application of this science to important societal problems like racism, as well as other pressing challenges such as promoting physical distancing during a pandemic. The essential starting point is to first properly define and measure specific social norms about race-related actions and speech in order to determine their breadth and strength across the population ( a type of research our Institute now plans to undertake ). Such information can then point to where interventions might be directed – to reinforce “positive norms” that are currently prevalent in society (no wearing of blackface) and de-normalizing “negative norms” (e.g., telling jokes that demean the “other”). This might take the form of public awareness campaigns (as was done to de-normalize public smoking) or employee-directed programs. Government and corporate leaders might be effective communicators of appropriate normative behaviour, to the extent they are credible and can exert influence over relevant audiences (which research might confirm). Today in Canada, our understanding of the current reality of racial injustice is at odds with our stated aspirations of justice and inclusion. This tension provides us with a valuable opportunity to create a more just society by developing new strategies that effectively apply normative pressures on each other to do a better job of treating each other as we ourselves expect to be treated.

Racism has deep historical roots and continues to shape our collective experience, presenting challenges that demand our attention and action. Racism is not confined to isolated incidents or individual prejudices; it permeates social structures, norms, and interactions, perpetuating inequality and marginalizing communities of color. It manifests in various forms, from overt acts of discrimination to subtle biases that persist within our cultural beliefs and attitudes. Photo by Clay Banks on Unsplash The influence of racism extends beyond individual prejudice; it shapes our political landscape and influences policy decisions. Political systems can either perpetuate racial inequalities or serve as vehicles for social change. We will explore examples of both overt and subtle racism in political discourse and discuss the impact of social justice movements on shaping political agendas. Race plays a significant role in the pursuit of social justice . Acknowledging and dismantling systemic racism is crucial to achieving equality and inclusivity. We will examine the importance of initiatives aimed at addressing racial disparities and advancing social justice for all individuals. Challenging racism requires a collective effort. Education, advocacy, allyship, and community engagement are crucial in promoting racial equity and combating prejudiced attitudes and behaviors. We will explore strategies and movements that are actively dismantling racism within our society .

Policy proposals designed to compensate descendants of enslaved people have recently regained both public and academic attention (Coates 2014, Darity and Mullen 2020a, 2020b, Ray and Perry 2020). Still, the concept of reparations remains divisive, possibly because perceptions diverge on why these inequalities persist. Black Americans and white Democrats tend to attribute racial inequality to past injustices, whereas white Republicans often point to individual choices or insufficient effort (Alesina et al. 2021). Our latest research presents unprecedented evidence of how deeply racial inequality was entrenched by anti-Black institutions (Althoff and Reichardt 2024). Our results reveal that Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved until the Civil War still have far lower economic status than Black Americans whose ancestors were free earlier. When and where their environment allowed, formerly enslaved families made considerable economic strides in the decades after becoming free. However, most families who were enslaved until the Civil War lived in regions where Jim Crow laws significantly impeded their economic advancement for almost a century after emancipation. Our evidence highlights the persistent systemic oppression of Black families in the Jim Crow South, which has severely limited their ability to achieve their full economic potential. It is only recently that such research has become possible. Measuring the degree to which Black families’ economic status is still influenced by the experiences of their ancestors is challenging. Many Black Americans themselves may not know their ancestors’ full stories, making it difficult to measure the long-term effects of enslavement and discrimination. Therefore, researchers face the difficult task of gathering and tracking vast amounts of modern and historical data for individual families to quantify the effects of these experiences. However, recent methodological breakthroughs, such as automated record linkage (Abramitzky et al. 2021), have made this task feasible. We have developed two innovative methods to identify the enslavement status of Black Americans’ ancestors. The first approach involves tracing the records of Black Americans from the present day back 160 years to their ancestors’ records. The earliest US censuses, in 1850 and 1860, recorded free Black Americans but not enslaved individuals; we classified those whose ancestors can be found in these censuses as descendants of free Black Americans and those whose ancestors could not be found as descendants of enslaved Black Americans. The second method is based on the surnames of Black families. We leveraged the fact that the surnames of free Black Americans often differ from those chosen by enslaved individuals who were freed after the Civil War. Specifically, we assessed the probability of each surname being linked to free Black families versus enslaved families by examining changes in surname frequency across censuses, comparing records exclusively listing free Black Americans to those incorporating (formerly) enslaved families. Our new methods revealed a stark disparity: Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved until the Civil War still face significant educational, income, and wealth gaps compared to descendants of those who gained their freedom earlier (see Figure 1). This gap, which we refer to as the ‘Free-Enslaved gap’, remains massive even in 2023, taking on magnitudes equal to 20–60% of the corresponding Black-white gaps. Figure 1 Free-enslaved gap, 1870–1940 Notes : Figure shows the gaps in literacy and occupation skill among prime-age (20–54) male descendants of enslaved versus free Black Americans in each census decade. Barriers to Black economic progress after slavery In 1865, when the Civil War ended slavery in the US, two groups of Black Americans existed. One group comprised newly freed Black families in the South (see Figure 2), who often emerged from the Civil War with no belongings and no ability to read or write. The other group was smaller and consisted of Black Americans who had been free before the war, many of them for several decades. These families could be found in both the North and South and had gained some level of wealth and education. Figure 2 Population by county in 1860 Notes : Figure shows the population sizes of enslaved Black Americans and free Black Americans in the 1860 census. After the abolition of slavery, Black Americans experienced a short period of progress known as Reconstruction. During this time, many Black Americans learned to read and write. Black men’s participation in voting also reached levels comparable to today’s rates, and many held political office. These achievements were possible due primarily to the presence of Northern Union troops, which ensured that the basic rights of Black Americans were protected in the South after the Civil War. However, the Jim Crow era began to significantly limit Black economic progress when Reconstruction efforts were abandoned, only 12 years after the end of slavery. Immediately after a political compromise led to the withdrawal of Northern troops in 1877, Southern states began to pass restrictive laws designed to limit Black economic progress. The Jim Crow regimes in different states had varying intensities, often taking away Black Americans’ ability to vote, restricting their economic and geographic mobility, and racially segregating various aspects of life. Black economic progress began to drastically diverge across Southern states after Jim Crow regimes were implemented. Our results show that Black families whose ancestors had been freed in states that adopted more oppressive policies made far less economic progress during the next century than those freed just a few miles away, on the less oppressive side of the same border (see Figure 3). To investigate the impact of Jim Crow, we zeroed in on Black families whose ancestors were freed in counties located along state borders within the South. For example, under Louisiana’s strict Jim Crow regime, Black families attained over a year’s less education by 1940 compared to families who were freed just a few miles away, in Texas – a state with a far weaker Jim Crow regime. The differences in long-term economic progress that emerged across each state border within the South can be explained by the differential intensity of their Jim Crow regimes. Jim Crow negatively impacted not just education, but also voter participation, school quality, and many other outcomes that were critical to Black economic progress. Figure 3 Regression discontinuity estimates and Jim Crow Notes : Figure relates regression discontinuities (RD) in Black economic progress across state borders (vertical axis) to differences in the intensity of states’ Jim Crow regimes (horizontal axis). Each separate RD estimate is measured in 1940 years of education for Black families whose ancestors were freed on different sides of state borders in 1865. Each label shows the more oppressive before the less oppressive state as measured by the Historical Racial Regime index (Baker 2022). Negative estimates reflect lower education in more oppressive states. Lines show the best linear fit between RD estimates and the differences in Jim Crow intensity, weighted by the inverse of the estimates’ standard error. Shaded areas represent robust 95% confidence bands. Our findings not only demonstrate the severe, negative impact of Jim Crow laws on the economic progress of the Black community, but also suggest that Jim Crow is the main reason why descendants of families enslaved until the Civil War still have lower economic status than Black families who were freed earlier. If formerly enslaved families had not been concentrated in the centre of Jim Crow, but rather distributed across the country like free Black Americans, the gap between free and enslaved Black families would have been closed by 1940. Repairing the impact of historical discrimination While our work stresses that systemic barriers have been a key reason why past discrimination continues to shape racial disparity today, we also show that targeted policies can repair the harm done by those institutions. Specifically, we study one of the most successful educational interventions in US history: the Rosenwald School programme (1910s to 1930s). This programme brought 5,000 schools for Black children to the South, schooling one-third of all Black children during the late Jim Crow era (Aaronson and Mazumder 2011). We show that Black children under the most oppressive regimes benefited the most from gaining access to such a school. This result highlights the immense demand for education that existed among Black Americans even if the returns to education were likely limited at the time. The economic fate of Black families today remains heavily influenced by conditions set in place more than 160 years ago, underscoring the urgent need for policies that address these deep-rooted disparities. Our research highlights the ways that institutions like Jim Crow, established post-slavery, significantly hindered the economic advancement of formerly enslaved people and their descendants (see also Katznelson 2006, Acharya et al. 2018). Consequently, reparations should not only acknowledge the legacy of slavery but also address subsequent anti-Black institutions. For example, US Senator Raphael Warnock proposed legislation in 2023 to repair the negative effects of discriminatory practices that largely excluded Southern Black veterans from one of the most significant government initiatives in US history, the WWII GI Bill (Warnock 2023, Bound and Turner 2003, Fetter 2013, Althoff and Szerman 2024).

The legacy of these events continues to impact racial inequality today, with descendants of enslaved families still facing significant economic and educational gaps compared to descendants of free Black Americans. Policies like the GI Bill and educational interventions like the Rosenwald School program have helped to address these disparities, but more work is needed to repair the harm done by historical discrimination. Additionally, the concept of white privilege and its manifestations at the individual, interpersonal, cultural, and institutional levels contribute to the persistence of racial inequality.

The starkest divides are in measures of household wealth, reflecting centuries of white privilege that have made it particularly difficult for people of color to achieve economic security. This series of charts begins with a look at how the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequalities. Racial Wealth Divide By the middle of the 21st century, the United States will be a “majority minority” nation. If we hope to ensure a strong middle class, historically the backbone of the national economy, then improving the financial health of households of color will become even more urgent than it is today. Closing the persistent “wealth divide” between white households and households of color, already a matter of social justice, must become a priority for broader economic policy. Public policies that favor white Americans and the wealthy have perpetuated both an extreme concentration of wealth and an extreme racial wealth divide. White households, Federal Reserve data show, held 84.2 percent of all U.S. wealth as of the fourth quarter of 2023, while making up only 66 percent of households. By contrast, Black families accounted for 11.4 percent of households and owned 3.4 percent of total family wealth, while Hispanic families represented 9.6 percent of households and owned 2.3 percent of total family wealth. These wealth figures include the value of consumer durable goods, such as vehicles. The racial wealth divide, according to Survey of Consumer Finances data, has narrowed slightly since 1989, but remains extremely wide. The median Black family has a net worth (including cars and other durable goods) of $44,100, just 15.5 percent of the $282,310 median white wealth. The typical Latino family, with $62,120, owns just 21.8 percent of the wealth of the median white family. The Institute for Policy Studies report, Ten Solutions to Bridge the Racial Wealth Divide , offers proposals for bold, structural reforms to address this problem. Families that have zero or even “negative” wealth (meaning the value of their debts exceeds the value of their assets) live on the edge, just one minor economic setback away from tragedy. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Federal Reserve data show that while the racial wealth gap has improved slightly, an estimated 28 percent of Black households and 26 percent of Latino households had zero or negative wealth in 2019, twice the level of whites. As with total wealth, home ownership is heavily skewed towards white families, our 2023 report with the National Community Reinvestment, Still a Dream , shows. Between 1960 and 2020, the rate of Black home ownership increased but the gap in ownership rates between Black and white families widened, from 26 percentage points to 30. Structural barriers, including lower incomes, higher rates of mortgage denials, and racial segregation, deny many Black families the opportunity to acquire this wealth-building asset. Black people also have to deal with larger student debt burdens. Black students on average have to take out larger loans to get through college than their white peers. A National Center for Education Statistics study reveals that Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree graduates face 13 percent and 26 percent more student debt, respectively, than their white peers. The challenge of paying off greater student debt is also worsened for Black graduates due to their lower average incomes. Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree holders earn 27 percent and 14 percent lower incomes , respectively, than whites with the same degree. Racial Income Inequality In 2021, Fortune 500 CEOs, who earned $18.3 million on average, included just four Black and 17 Latino people — just 4 percent of the total. By contrast, these groups made up 43 percent of the U.S. workers who would benefit from a raise in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, according to Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Economic Policy Institute data. Black and Latino people comprise 31 percent of the entire U.S. labor force. The world’s wealthiest country is home to numerous communities that have been poor for generations: think parts of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the southern border, and Chicago’s South Side. An Economic Innovation Group report finds that people of color are far more likely to live in “persistently poor” communities – defined as those with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher for at least 30 years – than white Americans. Racial discrimination in many forms, including in education, hiring, and pay practices, contributes to persistent earnings gaps. As of the third quarter of 2023, the median white worker made 24 percent more than the typical Black worker and around 28 percent more than the median Latino worker, according to BLS data . Race and Gender Inequality Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. While student loan burdens have grown significantly for all racial groups, they are particularly heavy for Black students — especially women. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, 43.3 percent of Black women are shouldering student loan debts, compared to just 15.7 percent of white men. Racial inequality in terms of the official poverty rate is also particularly acute for women of color. As National Women’s Law Center research shows, while in 2019 the U.S. poverty rate for white men is 6.0 percent, it is 18 percent for Black women, 15 percent for the Latino community, and 18 percent for Native American women. Racial Inequality and Covid-19 According to APM Research Lab , white and Asian Americans have substantially lower Covid-19 mortality rates than those of other racial and ethnic groups. Between the start of the pandemic and October 2, 2022, indigenous people suffered 582 deaths per 100,000 people – more than twice the death rate for whites and Asians. People of color are more likely to suffer severe illness from Covid-19, regardless of their age. According to CDC data , hospitalization rates have been highest among indigenous and Black Americans. About 2,100 indigenous and 1,700 Black Americans were hospitalized for Covid-related symptoms per 100,000 people in their respective ethnic and race groups between the beginning of the pandemic and October 22, 2022. The racial disparities in Covid-related health indicators have contributed to a steeper decline in the U.S. life expectancy for people of color, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the CDC. Between 2019 and 2021, American Indians and Alaska natives experienced the biggest drop, with life expectancy at birth plunging by more than 6 years to 65.2. The Latino and Black communities both experienced a drop of four years, while Asian and white Americans have seen a decrease of about two years since the start of the pandemic. The pandemic-related economic crisis in 2020 was particularly devastating for people of color. When the shutdown sent unemployment levels skyrocketing in March and April of that year, Black and Latino workers were much more likely to be jobless than white workers, according to BLS data . This remained true despite the fact that people of color made up a disproportionate share of essential workers who had to remain on the job at the start of the pandemic. While the overall unemployment rate has dropped significantly, racial disparities remain. In February 2025, Black unemployment stood at 6.0 percent, compared to 3.8 percent for white workers, according to BLS data . The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the share of U.S. workers who are teleworking for health reasons, but not everyone has the same ability to work from home. According to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Occupational Safety (NIOSH) and Health, Black and Non-white Hispanic workers are less likely to report being able to telework than white and Asian workers. Some 38 percent of Asian workers and 24 percent of white workers reported working from home between May 2020 and July 2021. By contrast, only 19 percent of Black and 14 percent and Non-white Hispanic workers reported working from home in that same time period. The researchers attributed 80 percent of this divide to racial education gaps, since college graduates are more likely to be able to telework. Workers of color with public-facing jobs have been exposed to greater virus risks.\'}]'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

In its early years, CORE staged a sit-in at a Chicago coffee shop (a precursor to the successful sit-in movement of 1960) and organized a “Journey of Reconciliation,” in which a group of Black and white activists rode together on a bus through the upper South in 1947, a year after the U.S. Supreme Court banned segregation in interstate bus travel. In Boynton v. Virginia (1960), the Court extended the earlier ruling to include bus terminals, restrooms and other related facilities, and CORE took action to test the enforcement of that ruling. In May 1961, CORE sent seven African Americans and six white Americans on a “freedom ride” on two buses from Washington, D.C. Bound for New Orleans , the freedom riders were attacked by angry segregationists outside of Anniston, Alabama, and one bus was even firebombed. Local law enforcement responded, but slowly, and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy eventually ordered State Highway Patrol protection for the freedom riders to continue to Montgomery, Alabama, where they again encountered violent resistance. Kennedy sent federal marshals to escort the riders to Jackson, Mississippi, but images of the bloodshed made the worldwide news, and the freedom rides continued. In September, under pressure from CORE and other civil rights organizations, as well as from the attorney general’s office, the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that all passengers on interstate bus carriers should be seated without regard to race and carriers could not mandate segregated terminals. Integration of Ole Miss, September 1962 By the end of the 1950s, African Americans had begun to be admitted in small numbers to white colleges and universities in the South without too much incident. In 1962, however, a crisis erupted when the state-funded University of Mississippi (known as “Ole Miss”) admitted a Black man , James Meredith. After nine years in the Air Force, Meredith had studied at the all–Black Jackson State College and applied repeatedly to Ole Miss with no success. With the aid of the NAACP, Meredith filed a lawsuit alleging that the university had discriminated against him because of his race. In September 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Meredith’s favor, but state officials including Governor Ross Barnett vowed to block his admission. When Meredith arrived at Ole Miss under the protection of federal forces including U.S. marshals, a mob of more than 2,000 people formed on the Oxford, Mississippi campus. Two people were killed and close to 200 injured in the ensuing chaos, which ended only after President Kennedy’s administration sent some 31,000 troops to restore order. Meredith went on to graduate from Ole Miss in 1963, but the struggle to integrate higher education continued. Later that year, Governor George Wallace blocked the enrollment of a Black student at the University of Alabama, pledging to “stand in the schoolhouse door.” Though Wallace was eventually forced by the federalized National Guard to integrate the university, he became a prominent symbol of the ongoing resistance to desegregation nearly a decade after Brown v. Board of Education. Birmingham Church Bombed, 1963 Despite Martin Luther King Jr.’s inspiring words at the Lincoln Memorial during the historic March on Washington in August 1963, violence against Black people in the segregated South continued to indicate the strength of white resistance to the ideals of justice and racial harmony King espoused. In mid-September, white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama during Sunday services; four young African American girls were killed in the explosion. The church bombing was the third in 11 days after the federal government had ordered the integration of Alabama’s school system. Governor George Wallace was a leading foe of desegregation, and Birmingham had one of the strongest and most violent chapters of the Ku Klux Klan. Birmingham had become a leading focus of the civil rights movement by the spring of 1963 when Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested there while leading supporters of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in a nonviolent campaign of demonstrations against segregation. While in jail, King wrote a letter to local white ministers justifying his decision not to call off the demonstrations in the face of continued bloodshed at the hands of local law enforcement officials, led by Birmingham’s police commissioner, Eugene “Bull” Connor. “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” was published in the national press even as images of police brutality against protesters in Birmingham–including children being attacked by police dogs and knocked off their feet by fire hoses–sent shock waves around the world, helping to build crucial support for the civil rights movement. \'I Have a Dream,\' 1963 On August 28, 1963, some 250,000 people—both Black and white—participated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the largest demonstration in the history of the nation’s capital and the most significant display of the civil rights movement’s growing strength. After marching from the Washington Monument, the demonstrators gathered near the Lincoln Memorial, where a number of civil rights leaders addressed the crowd, calling for voting rights, equal employment opportunities for Black Americans and an end to racial segregation. The last leader to appear was the Baptist preacher Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), who spoke eloquently of the struggle facing Black Americans and the need for continued action and nonviolent resistance. “ I have a dream ,” King intoned, expressing his faith that one day white and Black people would stand together as equals, and there would be harmony between the races: “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” King’s improvised sermon continued for nine minutes after the end of his prepared remarks, and his stirring words would be remembered as undoubtedly one of the greatest speeches in American history. At its conclusion, King quoted an “old Negro spiritual: ‘Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\'” King’s speech served as a defining moment for the civil rights movement, and he soon emerged as its most prominent figure. Civil Rights Act of 1964, July 1964 Thanks to the campaign of nonviolent resistance championed by Martin Luther King Jr. beginning in the late 1950s, the civil rights movement had begun to gain serious momentum in the United States by 1960. That year, John F. Kennedy made passage of new civil rights legislation part of his presidential campaign platform; he won more than 70 percent of the African American vote. Congress was debating Kennedy’s civil rights reform bill when he was killed by an assassin’s bullet in Dallas, Texas in November 1963. It was left to Lyndon Johnson (not previously known for his support of civil rights) to push the Civil Rights Act —the most far-reaching act of legislation supporting racial equality in American history—through Congress in June 1964. At its most basic level, the act gave the federal government more power to protect citizens against discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin. It mandated the desegregation of most public accommodations, including lunch counters, bus depots, parks and swimming pools, and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to ensure equal treatment of minorities in the workplace. The act also guaranteed equal voting rights by removing biased registration requirements and procedures and authorized the U.S. Office of Education to provide aid to assist with school desegregation. In a televised ceremony on July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law using 75 pens; he presented one of them to King, who counted it among his most prized possessions. Freedom Summer and the \'Mississippi Burning\' Murders, June 1964 In the summer of 1964, civil rights organizations including the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) urged white students from the North to travel to Mississippi, where they helped register Black voters and build schools for Black children. The organizations believed the participation of white students in the so-called “Freedom Summer” would bring increased visibility to their efforts. The summer had barely begun, however, when three volunteers—Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both white New Yorkers, and James Chaney, a Black Mississippian—disappeared on their way back from investigating the burning of an African American church by the Ku Klux Klan. After a massive FBI investigation (code–named “Mississippi Burning”) their bodies were discovered on August 4 buried in an earthen dam near Philadelphia, in Neshoba County, Mississippi. Although the culprits in the case—white supremacists who included the county’s deputy sheriff—were soon identified, the state made no arrests. The Justice Department eventually indicted 19 men for violating the three volunteers’ civil rights (the only charge that would give the federal government jurisdiction over the case) and after a three-year-long legal battle, the men finally went on trial in Jackson, Mississippi. In October 1967, an all-white jury found seven of the defendants guilty and acquitted the other nine. Though the verdict was hailed as a major civil rights victory—it was the first time anyone in Mississippi had been convicted for a crime against a civil rights worker—the judge in the case gave out relatively light sentences, and none of the convicted men served more than six years behind bars.

Often, the rationale for separating these children from their families was rooted in the assimilation doctrine of the time and not performed in the best interest of the children or their families.

In many respects, it can be traced back to the founding of a nation on the promise of freedom while dependent on slavery, a time when many couldn’t participate in the democracy being created.

Please adapt this lesson plan as needed to fit the specific needs and dynamics of your classroom. Introduction The fact that our country is divided isn’t new. In many respects, it can be traced back to the founding of a nation on the promise of freedom while dependent on slavery, a time when many couldn’t participate in the new democracy. In this lesson, students will watch a video in which Judy Woodruff examines how that founding contradiction has evolved and what it means for us today. They will then examine a primary source chosen by the teacher and connect it to the themes of the NewsHour story. Materials Computers or tablets with internet access Projector and screen for displaying the news article Whiteboard and markers Copies of the news article (if available) Grades: 9-12 Estimated time: One or two 50-minute periods Objectives Students will critically analyze a NewsHour segment about the history of racism in America and its impact on contemporary divisions. Students will examine a primary source to deepen their understanding of the topic. Students will reflect on the implications of this history for political divisio today. Warm-up activity Begin the lesson by asking students if they are aware of the concept of systemic racism or the history of racism in the United States. Write down key terms and concepts on the whiteboard. Explain that today\\\'s lesson will focus on understanding the history of racism in America and how it influences contemporary societal divisions. Show the headline and image from the NewsHour Story: " A look at the history of racism in America and its role in today\\\'s divisions ." Main activity Part 1 (20 minutes) As a class, watch this NewsHour story (11 minutes) VIDEO Instruct students to watch the story carefully, highlighting key points and taking notes. They can also follow along or annotate the transcript found here . After watching the video, discuss as a class: What are the main historical events and policies mentioned in the story that have contributed to racism in America? How do these historical factors continue to impact American society today? Are there specific quotes or statistics from the article that stood out to you? Why? Part 2 (20 minutes) Divide the class into small groups and provide each group with a primary source related to a significant event or period mentioned in the article (e.g., excerpts from historical speeches, documents, or photographs related to the Civil Rights Movement). Ask each group to analyze their primary source and discuss how it reflects the effects of racism within the source\\\'s historical context. They should also consider how this source connects to issues in today\\\'s society. Have each group share their findings with the class. Reflection and Discussion Lead a brief class discussion on the following questions: How does understanding the history of racism help us make sense of current societal divisions and challenges? What can individuals and society do to address the legacy of racism discussed in the article? Wrap-up Conclude the lesson by summarizing the key takeaways and emphasizing the importance of understanding historical context in addressing contemporary issues related to racism. Assign homework or further reading related to the topic, if desired. Extension activities Watch a relevant documentary or movie that further explores the history of racism in America. Invite a guest speaker, such as a local historian or community activist, to discuss their experiences and insights on this topic. Encourage students to research and present on a specific event or figure mentioned in the article in more detail. Assign a short essay or reflection paper where students elaborate on the implications of the article for modern-day America.

And then, in May, video footage of the horrific murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police ignited a blaze of protest that spread across the United States and also Canada, a country with its own history of colonialism and racism. The depth of the reflection and conversation – public and private – provoked by the protests was unprecedented. For the first time, many of this country’s leaders unequivocally acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in Canada, and reflected the predominant public sentiment. Our own research shows that a significant majority of Canadians now recognize the reality of racial discrimination in this country, especially as it affects people who are Indigenous and Black. Such recognition of racism in our society is a significant milestone, long in coming. Doing something about it becomes the next step, and represents an even greater challenge given how deeply such prejudice is embedded in Canada’s dominant culture and institutions. Evidence of its pervasiveness confronts us both in personal anecdotes and in hard data on racial disparities across many areas of society – from policing and health to education and social welfare. It is commonly believed that the biggest obstacle to meaningful change is our inability to recognize our own racial prejudices. The prevalence of unconscious racism or “implicit bias” has been well documented by American social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt (in her seminal book, Biased) and others. Some have responded by taking steps to make the implicit explicit through education generally, and diversity and anti-racism training in particular. Governments and corporations have invested in programs to teach employees about bias and stereotypes, hoping that raising consciousness will change attitudes, assumptions, and behaviour. But the evidence is emerging that this strategy is not effective in producing lasting change, as recently reported in a meta-analysis of close to 1,000 studies of anti-bias interventions. Efforts to reduce bias through education and training may simply not work because it is impossible to change people’s ingrained mindsets and emotions, at least in the short term. A more promising avenue to consider is the social context in which people operate when they interact with others. Implicit in diversity training is the idea that racism is fuelled mainly by what people know and think, but what matters more is what people say and how they behave in the presence of others. Outward expressions of racism are governed in large part by collective social norms about acceptable behaviour. The term “norms” sometimes gets mentioned in the context of problematic content on social media, but what has yet to receive any serious attention is the concept of “social norms” as a fundamental aspect of society that contributes to the systemic nature of racism and where we might focus to address the problem. Social norms are widely held expectations about what is, and is not, acceptable to say and do in particular situations. What is distinctive about such norms is that they are not defined by what people think is important to them personally, but by what they see as the social expectations of others whose opinions matter to them. As such, norms exert a powerful influence on how people act in public and social situations, quite apart from what they may think or feel inside. These norms are typically well entrenched but do change over time. The Holocaust led many people to decide it was no longer acceptable to articulate anti-Jewish stereotypes. The growing awareness of LGBTQ individuals in society and the legislative endorsement of same-sex marriage both improved attitudes and also made it no longer socially acceptable to trade in homophobic slurs. Many people may still harbour negative views about Jews and LGBTQ people, but most now understand it is no longer okay to express them. Sometimes social norms change as a result of intentional efforts. Arguably the most striking example is the successful campaign to change norms around tobacco use in public. Just over a generation ago, smoking in public was common, even cool. Today, the behaviour has become effectively “denormalized” as inconsiderate and self-defeating, even as a significant proportion of the population continues to smoke in private. Regulatory measures that restrict smoking in public settings are also important, but it is the norms more than the laws that govern behaviour. By contrast, consider jaywalking, which is also legally forbidden but widely socially accepted. Social norms play a key role in the dynamics of racism and prejudice because they establish the boundaries around which people act toward those they see as “other.” While internal attitudes and stereotypes are stubbornly resistant to short-term change, action and speech are more amenable to influence and normative pressures. This means that focusing on social norms can be an effective strategy for addressing racism in a meaningful way – especially if the collective norms against intolerance and discrimination are strengthening, which now appears to be happening. Evidence for this can be found in the recent public condemnation of wearing “blackface” in costume, which in a different era was considered by many to be harmless party attire. There is nothing new about the concept of social norms, which social scientists have studied in academic settings and applied to public health challenges in developing countries. What has been missing is the practical application of this science to important societal problems like racism, as well as other pressing challenges such as promoting physical distancing during a pandemic. The essential starting point is to first properly define and measure specific social norms about race-related actions and speech in order to determine their breadth and strength across the population ( a type of research our Institute now plans to undertake ). Such information can then point to where interventions might be directed – to reinforce “positive norms” that are currently prevalent in society (no wearing of blackface) and de-normalizing “negative norms” (e.g., telling jokes that demean the “other”). This might take the form of public awareness campaigns (as was done to de-normalize public smoking) or employee-directed programs. Government and corporate leaders might be effective communicators of appropriate normative behaviour, to the extent they are credible and can exert influence over relevant audiences (which research might confirm). Today in Canada, our understanding of the current reality of racial injustice is at odds with our stated aspirations of justice and inclusion. This tension provides us with a valuable opportunity to create a more just society by developing new strategies that effectively apply normative pressures on each other to do a better job of treating each other as we ourselves expect to be treated.

However, one common theme has been a greater desire for education, in the knowledge that understanding is the opposite of bigotry. The #BlackLivesMatter movement has sought to expose the extent of racism; it is a problem that is manifested not only in extreme crimes perpetrated by a problematic minority, but also in the daily experience of people of colour, through “ micro-aggressions ” and implicit bias. This article seeks to offer a brief explanation of the psychological answer to the question: what drives the majority of otherwise fundamentally “good” white people — people who, if asked, would likely state an abhorrence of racism — to exhibit such bias? In short, why are “good people” racist? Can we, by learning why we might have certain prejudice, use that knowledge to deal with implicit biases? To address this problem, we shall first consider evidence for the instinct of humans to form competing groups. By analysing how this can be applied to racism, we will then examine theories, which suggest how such biases can be overcome. The evolutionary background As humans, one of the most basic instincts we have is towards group formation. This desire to form groups can also be seen in our closest evolutionary relation, other great apes ( hominidae ), and is pervasive in human culture. Indeed, for many, one of the greatest hardships of the Coronavirus Pandemic is being without friends and family, a reflection of how crucial contact with other humans is to our well-being, a need that is derived from its importance in human evolution: For example, group living increases safety and security, and thus also survival chances and reproduction. Evolutionary theorists such as Dunbar et al. (2005) have proposed that genes supporting group living might have been selected for during evolution. A necessary consequence of groups being beneficial is that there will be many of them, all competing for the same, limited resources. For our ancestors this would have been water sources, land and perhaps the tastiest berries. For us, it might be jobs or career and educational opportunities. It is not hard to see, therefore, why individuals in a group turn inwards, favouring members of their own group (the ‘in-group’) at the expense of the competing groups (‘out-groups’). This idea has been evidenced by a number of studies. Robber’s Cave Summer Camp Studies In the 1960s, Sherif et al. (1961) conducted the “Robber’s Cave Summer Camp Studies”. In these experiments, young (12 year old) middle class boys, who did not know one another beforehand were sent together on summer camps. They had been screened to ensure they did not have psychological disorders such as psychopathy, which could have meant that the actions of the individuals were not truly representative of the general population and thus bias the results. The boys were randomly divided into two teams and engaged in team bonding activities, to consolidate grouping. The two groups played a series of zero-sum games, where one team’s win necessarily meant another’s loss, such as tug-of-war. As predicted, this led to genuine conflict and dislike between the groups, manifested in explicit negative attitudes and behaviours towards the out-group. At one point, they even organised and met for a fight between the groups, only prevented by the arrival of the experimenters. The researchers then tried a variety of techniques to get the boys from opposing groups to like each other despite group differences. The only successful method consisted of the introduction of “superordinate goals”, i.e. goals that could only be reached by both groups working together. One such superordinate goal was to obtain lunch from a truck stuck in the mud. The truck could only be retrieved with both groups working together to pull it out. Sherif et al. found that while one superordinate goal was insufficient to reduce hostility permanently, a series of such goals eventually resulted in the groups becoming friends. One of the groups even shared $5 they had won to buy lunch for all of the boys. This study is pivotal; the boys were all from the same area, same background, had similar levels of sporting ability and were all at the higher IQ range of the spectrum, as assessed by their teachers, and yet the experimenters were able to generate real dislike and rivalry along totally arbitrary lines by simply introducing competition. This demonstrates just how embedded in our nature group rivalry is, and also further supports the evolutionary argument for its causes. Rivalry occurred mostly because of limited resources and disappeared when resources could only be gained by the two groups working together. The Minimal Group Paradigm study However, findings from the “Minimal Group Paradigm” by Tajfel et al. (1971) suggests that group rivalry may occur along arbitrary lines, in the absence of real resource competition. Here, the presence of competition for resources is not a necessary precondition for group rivalry. In this experiment, groups of adults were asked which abstract painting they preferred out of two similar examples. They were then told that they had been separated into groups based on whether they had an overall preference for paintings by Klee or Kandinsky. In reality, however, the two groups were assigned entirely at random, and each person only knew that they were a member of one group, without ever meeting or seeing the other members of their assigned group. All participants were then asked to distribute money between the groups. While, perhaps unsurprisingly, there was a general preference to favour the in-group, the key finding from this study was that, given the choice, participants always preferred a scenario in which their own group gained more money than the out-group. Participants even decided to renounce additional gain for themselves if the alternative meant equal winnings for the out-group. For example, in a choice between giving their own group £9 and the out-group £8, or their own group £7 and the out-group £2, they would choose the latter . They therefore chose to maximise difference between groups rather than maximise net gain . It is important to note that these groups were entirely arbitrary, they meant nothing for the participants as soon as the experiment was over, and the participants never met the other members of the group. Yet stillthere was a statistically significant move towards derogating the out-group, even if that came at some expense to the in-group. These two experiments taken together show how deeply entrenched group attachments are. Even though evolutionary science and the summer camp study suggest that these intrinsic biases are derived from the benefits that group membership confers in an environment with conflict and limited resources, they exist beyond that, even in situations where the group lines are meaningless and confer no advantage. This might be due to the evolutionary high ground of genes that promote an instinct for group formation under all circumstances, simply because groups generally confer evolutionary advantage. That instinct would therefore be preserved in our nature today; the context does not necessarily matter. Practical relevance What do these findings mean practically? The evidence presented so far goes some way to explaining racism; we have a strong desire to form groups, those groups are mutually competitive, and there does not necessarily need to be a real reason for the groups to be formed other than for their own sake; the lines can be utterly arbitrary. Considered in the context of racism, this starts to explain why different races or nationalities experience conflict with one another; race is, after all, a very simple dividing line. For a species so prone to group formation, it is perhaps unsurprising to also find division based on characteristics so obvious and unavoidable. Grouping as an identity trait To further explain how natural predisposition towards group formation can explain why fundamentally good people can be racist, we need to consider the extent to which group membership is important to them. That is, we do not only feel an urge towards group formation, but we also consider group affiliation as part of our identity. For example, if you were asked to describe yourself, you might say, ‘I go to X University and I support Y football team’. Whilst of course group membership is not the only factor defining your identity, it is an important feature. This was empirically demonstrated by Volz et al. (2009), who evaluated the extent to which individual self-concept was aligned with group self-concept. For this, they used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow, and examined activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The mPFC is a brain region associated with many functions, including the processing of information relevant to one’s self concept (i.e. what you think of you ). Volz et al. ’s study used Tajfel et al. ’s arbitrary group allocation paradigm and scanned participants’ brain activity while they were engaged in reward distribution tasks. These tasks were designed to measure strategies of fairness and intergroup discrimination in the allocation of rewards to in-group and out-group members. The participants who showed morein-group bias also had greateractivation of the mPFC. This may suggest that the more group membership is considered part of an individual’s identity, the more likely they are to show in-group bias and consequently derogate the out-group. This conclusion has clear practical implications. If the extent to which group membership defines self-concept is directly linked to out-group degradation, then helping people to recognise this is vital. For example, the more that individuals identify as “white British” and value that attribute as important to who they are, the more likely they are to hold implicit or explicit biases against those who are not “white British”. The “Football Fans” experiment The idea of saliency of group membership (i.e. the extent to which a person’s attention is focused onto a specific group identity) and the strength of identification with that group being a key causal factor in derogation of the out-group is further highlighted by a significant study by Levine et al. ’s (2005) ‘football fans’ experiment. The subjects in this study were Manchester United F.C. fans, who have significant rivalry with the supporters of Liverpool F.C. They had to answer questions about their support for Manchester United, in order to make their support for their football team salient in their mind, and were then told they had to walk to a nearby building to finish the second part of the study. As the participants walked to the building, another experimenter, acting the part of a passer-by on a jog, ran past before slipping and falling, grabbing his ankle and shouting in pain. The key experimental manipulation was the colour of the shirt that the “jogger” was wearing: one group of fans saw him wearing a red Manchester United shirt; another group saw him with a red Liverpool shirt, and the final (control) group saw him wearing a plain red shirt. The dependent variable was what proportion of the participants would stop and help, and how this varied based on his shirt’s colour. The proportions did indeed vary; when the “jogger” was wearing a Manchester United shirt, circa 90%of individuals stopped to help, compared tocirca 30%for the Liverpool shirt and control shirt conditions. Even more interestingly, in a second experiment, the researches recreated the conditions of the original study but with a crucial change – instead of giving questionnaires emphasising team alliance before meeting the “jogger”, they were given questionnaires emphasising their overall love of “the game”, i.e. football. All other conditions were kept the same. This time the results were starkly different; circa 80%helped the Manchester fan, circa 70%helped the Liverpool fan, while only 20% helped the control confederate. “the war on climate change”, or more topically, “the fight against the virus” are superordinate goals which […] may help to reduce animosity between different countries and groups of people This is a crucial finding: arbitrary differences (such as which football team one supports and whether this group identity is further reinforced), can significantly influence one’s behaviour towards another person . [1] The fact that the level of help offered to Liverpool fans increased dramatically when the group lines were redrawn points to a key way in which we can help combat racism, namely encouraging ourselves to think of people of differing races as similar to us because of certain characteristics they share, and making those shared characteristics more salient in our minds than those of race. It is obvious that on a global level, encouraging people to think of others as members of “humankind”, and what unites us as humans, is a necessary attitude in order to eradicate divisions between people, especially if that conceptualisation is against something else. For example, “the war on climate change”, or more topically, “the fight against the virus” are superordinate goals which require the type of group efforts highlighted in the “Summer Camp Studies” by Sherif et al. ; tackling such problems may thus help to reduce animosity between different countries and groups of people. Distinctiveness A further important point to note about racial divisions is distinctiveness; that is, people in the out-group are seen as more homogenous, similar between themselves and less distinctive than the in-group. This was shown by Hamilton and Gifford (1976) through the illusory correlations effect, which describes a perception of links between variables even when there is no actual relationship between them. In this study participants were given a series of slides depicting individual behaviours from people who were either supposedly in group A (the majoritygroup), or group B (the minoritygroup). The ratio of good to bad behaviours was kept the same for both groups. Behaviours used included ‘helped an old lady across a road’, or ‘cheated in an exam’, i.e. minor positive or negative acts. The participants were then presented with the slides again, but this time the name of the group the behaviour belonged to, i.e. group A or B was removed, and the participant had to remember which group the behaviour had come from. It was found that the participants ascribed a greater ratio of negative behaviours to group B, the minority group. Interestingly, this is not simply a case of minority groups being naturally viewed as worse. When the study was repeated by presenting for both groups a greater ratio of bad to good behaviour, where the amount of bad behaviour significantly outweighed the good, the participants associated the good behaviour more with the minority group. “Humans, as “cognitive misers”, are thought to be more inclined to search for features that make a group distinctive, in order to quickly and easily categorise them, and not think much more about it.” The authors explained this finding in terms of the higher accessibility in memory of the most distinctive combination. That is, in the condition where there was greater good than bad behaviour, the bad behaviour was distinctive, as it was the exception to the norm. Similarly, the minority group was distinctive as it was the exception to the majority norm. Conversely, in the condition where the majority of the behaviour was bad, the behaviour that was distinctive was the good behaviour. The authors postulated that people connected the two distinctive features together, causing the bias observed. While there remains some debate over the mechanism, the observed results are useful to examine a propensity to view a perceived distinctive feature of the out-group as representative of the whole. This study and others following it have thus been used as evidence to support the argument that the out-group is seen as less distinctive. Humans, as “cognitive misers”, are thought to be more inclined to search for features that make a group distinctive, in order to quickly and easily categorise them, and not think much more about it. That said, follow-up studies have shown that motivational factors, deriving from group membership, can overcome this bias. This bias is in many ways sensible from an evolutionary perspective: why waste valuable cognitive resources evaluating a group you don’t have much contact with? However, it is immensely dangerous from the standpoint of the fight against racism. It is not the purpose of this article to address the systemic factors that contribute to racism. Yet these are the likely immediate cause for the disproportionate representation of the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) demographic in the lower socioeconomic groups. There is evidence to suggest the presence of institutional racism in the police force, causing people in the BAME demographic to be more likely to be arrested for a given crime than those of other demographics ( Eastwood et al. 2013 ). With this higher number of arrests being common knowledge, people of non-BAME demographics are more likely to consider criminal activity to be representative of a typical black person. This is likely due to the distinctiveness effect discussed previously, and may also be augmented by a rule of thumb in psychology called the “availability heuristic”. This states that people ascribe greater importance to things they can easily call to mind. “We are already predisposed to fail to properly distinguish between individual members of racial out-groups.” This is further complicated by the findings of Kelly et al. (2005, 2007). This developmental psychology study discovered that from as young as 9 months old, children who are of race A and brought up around race A are significantly more able to differentiate between similar looking faces of race A than similar looking faces of face B. That is to say, two separate but similar faces of race A would be perceived as different, whereas two separate but similar faces of race B would be perceived as the same. This might simply be again an evolutionary effect: there is little point for early humans in wasting valuable cognitive resources learning to differentiate between groups one rarely sees. Yet this has significant practical effects in modern society. What we have, therefore, is a natural psychological bias to see the actions of some of the out-group, which are highlighted as distinctive to us, as representative of the whole out-group. In a society that regularly exposes us to these negative aspects through systemic racism, and, in addition, because of an evolved innate bias, we are already predisposed to fail to properly distinguish between individual members of racial out-groups, even beforewe consider our psychological disposition towards viewing the out-group as homogenous. Therefore, the problem is clear. Humans are predisposed to form groups and to prioritise the group which they are part of, at the expense of any out-groups. Despite the fact that these groups can, and do, form along totally arbitrary lines, the dislike between them is real and keenly felt. In addition, due to other psychological factors, we are predisposed to consider the out-group as more homogenous, thereby allowing negative stereotypes to easily end up being applied to them, especially as these stereotypes are propagated by systemic racism. It is all too easy to see this playing out in real-life, such as when the violent actions of small extremist fringe groups of larger organisations or religions are used as the justification for targeting the whole group. Solutions to the problem How do we solve this? There is obviously no single simple solution, and this article most certainly does not claim to have one. The explanation this article wishes to give, however, is that we are all, through no fault of our own, predisposed to have racist biases, and these relate to a variety of evolutionary and psychological factors. The problem of racism (and other forms of discrimination) therefore comes from a failure to challenge such predisposed biases. “The first step to challenging such biases is an awareness of their existence .” The crucial response this article seeks to promote is that of the reader seeking to challenge such instincts about members of an out-group. There is substantial evidence affirming that, as would be logically expected, individuals who are more motivated to challenge racial biases become significantly less racist than their peers, and the first step to challenging such biases is an awareness of their existence. While these biases might be drawn from evolution, we are highly intelligent creatures who are not simply governed by our instinctive feelings; we have the power to recognise prejudice in ourselves and challenge it, and, over time, change ourselves. This ability, that we are not purely governed by our instincts but have the ability to reason morally, is what likely sets us apart from our evolutionary ancestors, and why there is no excuse for racism. Psychological interventions to decrease racism All the evidence about means to decrease racism suggests that exposure is an excellent place to start. Ceasing to see others as members of an artificial out-group is important, as this way the idea of reformulating groups makes salient other attributes. For example, if one had a shared interest (e.g. both playing tennis), with a member of an out-group, this shared feature could be made salient, i.e. should be seen as more representative of someone’s identity than the person’s affiliation with, for example, the BAME demographic. Additionally, it is argued that in order to reduce prejudice, one must combat the predisposition to seeing members of an out-group as representative of that group. In everyday life, to meet people of the BAME demographic and consider them to be “like you” but at the same time thinking of them as different to a “typical” member of their ethnical group completely fails to reduce overall prejudice. Models of reducing prejudice support a theory of “dual categorisation” ( Gaertner & Dovido 2000, Hornsey and Hogg 2000 ), where bias between groups was found to be maximally reduced when previously opposing groups considered themselves as part of a superordinate identity and a subgroup within this. This is thought to be due to the fact that humans need distinctive group formation, as discussed above, and having only a superordinate identity, i.e. being a member of humankind, does not convey that necessary distinctiveness. However, it has been found that intergroup bias can be successfully reduced if we think of ourselves as belonging to the superordinate identity and of a sub-group within that, such as belonging to a university and a college within it. This can be easily analogised within the context of Oxford – at Summer VIIIs, one might ardently support one’s own college and feel dislike towards other competing colleges. However, when watching the Boat Race, one would support Oxford, and the dislike towards other Oxford Colleges would have disappeared; rivalry is now centred on Cambridge. Nevertheless, when they introduce the rowers for each boat, if one saw a member of one’s own college, one might be particularly keen for that rower to do well. In a racial context, this can be useful, as it means that members of BAME demographics do not have to give up their culture to “fit in”, and members of other demographics are able to recognise that including BAME people does not mean they have to change their cultural preferences. Therefore, while we may all be predisposed to a background level of unconscious racial bias, we also have the power to do something about it. Challenging one’s thoughts and recognising when one has assumed something because it is easy to do so, is the first step – an implicit bias test is another excellent way to start. Project Implicit from Harvard University provides a good version – it can be found at this link: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html Without purporting to offer any solutions further than increased education, this article has merely touched on several of the background psychological considerations which factor into the attitudes of members of perceived in-groups and out-groups. For further reading, material in this area is extensive, and chapter 14 of Hewstone et al. (2015), An Introduction to Social Psychology is an excellent place to start. [1] As an aside, it is important to consider when reading this study that the confederate is not in life threatening danger – it is likely, although there is no evidence for this, that had they been, they would have been helped in higher proportions across conditions. However, this is the point of this article; it is not the aim to address here why some police officers are brutally racist, or why there are too many instances of violent assault on minority groups. There are far more factors that feed into this type of behaviour; such a discussion is beyond the scope of this article. What this article does seek to address is why ‘average’ people, although this term is of course in and of itself loaded, behave with discrimination and exhibit covert racism, and this study goes some way toward answering this.

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”'}, {'title': 'Psychology of Racism - Introduction to Social Psychology', 'url': 'https://open.maricopa.edu/socialpsychology/chapter/psychology-of-racism/', 'content': 'By Phia Salter , Glenn Adams, and Tuğçe Kurtiş Davidson College, University of Kansas, Prescott College Thinking about racism as solely a problem among a certain set of biased or prejudiced individuals can lead us to underestimate the problem of racism. This module describes a systemic approach to understanding racism and the implications of such an approach in psychology. Systemic approaches emphasize the important roles historical, cultural, legal, political, and economic systems have in reproducing contemporary forms of racism. By engaging this module, students will be able to better understand the implications of a systemic (versus individualistic) approach in psychology for anti-racist research, anti-racist practices, and anti-racist interventions. Distinguish individual and systemic approaches to racism in psychology Understand race as a social construction and its historical and contemporary links to racism Learn about psychological mechanisms related to differences in perceptions of racism Understand the implications of a systemic approach to racism for research and intervention efforts Consider important connections between overlapping identities and oppression Introduction In 2020, Kennedy Mitchum–a recent college graduate–wrote a series of emails to the editors at Merriam-Webster dictionary, asking them to update their online definitions of racism. At the time, the definition–which had not been significantly revised in decades–contained three entries: Racism is “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences reflect an inherent superiority of a particular race” (or, in other words: racial bigotry) Racism is “a doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles”. (Racism as “doctrine” highlights racism as a set of beliefs held by different political systems like Apartheid or groups like White Supremacists) Racism is “racial prejudice or discrimination.” These definitions might be similar to the ways in which you think about racism. Indeed, these definitions are widely used and they frame everyday discussions of the topic. Thinking about racism as a problem among a certain set of biased or prejudiced people can lead us to underestimate the problem of racism. This is because it narrows the focus to individual acts motivated by hate or ignorance and it overlooks more systemic biases. In this module, we will discuss racism as a multifaceted and multi-level concept. Different Understandings of Racism VIDEO In her email to the dictionary editors, Mitchum wrote, “Racism is not only prejudice against a certain race due to the color of a person’s skin, as it states in your dictionary. It is both prejudice combined with social and institutional power. It is a system of advantage based on skin color” (Hauser, 2020). Spurred by the exchange with Mitchum and the Black Lives Matter Protests in the summer of 2020, the editors updated their definition of racism which now has two entries. The first entry maintains the definition of racism as individual beliefs but the second now explicitly emphasizes racism as systemic oppression. This change is consistent with scholarship that defines racism as a system of advantage and disadvantage based on social, historical, and cultural constructions of race and ethnicity (Jones, 1997/1998; Tatum, 1997; Wellman, 1993). Though this view is generally accepted by psychologists now, it has not always been the case. In psychology, the term racism has sometimes been used synonymously with prejudice (biased feelings or affect), stereotyping (biased thoughts and beliefs, or flawed generalizations), discrimination (differential or the absence of equal treatment), and bigotry (intolerance or hatred toward those with differing beliefs) (Adams et al., 2008a; Adams et al., 2008b). This approach reduces racism to its most basic parts at the individual level so that it can more easily be studied in a laboratory. However, it risks minimizing the institutional, systemic, and cultural processes that inform racism. Research suggests that different understandings of racism—as a problem of individual bias versus a structurally embedded force—are not randomly distributed across people. In the United States, understanding of racism as individual bias is especially pronounced among White Americans (Blauner, 2019; Carter & Murphy, 2015; Sommers & Norton, 2006). For example, Figure 1 (left side) shows the results of polls (Pew Research Center, 2016) that generally find that White Americans are far more likely than Black Americans to define the problem of racism narrowly as discrimination “based on the prejudice of individuals.” Conversely, Black Americans are more likely than White Americans to define the problem of racism more broadly as discrimination “built into laws and institutions.” Beyond differences in the definition of racism, researchers have also noted group differences in perceptions of the role that racism plays in the modern world. Consider the results of another survey that also appear in Figure 1 (right side). Across several social issues, the percentage of participants who believe that racism impacts a wide range of social problems is much lower among White American than among Black American respondents. Figure 1.

First, ‘race’ itself, is a social construct . Racial categories are arbitrary in that there is not substantial scientific evidence supporting a clear biological division of ‘races.’ Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why there are four or five common categories, but not 3, 29, or 101? Even though we treat racial categories as if they are true biological distinctions, they are not. Human beings share 99.9% of their genetic makeup (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2018). Most people have physical characteristics or phenotypes that could be associated with more than one racial group. In fact, there are no traits that are only present in one population or ‘race’. There are many expressions of traits found within and across different racial groups (see the images in Figure 2, for example). To say that race is an arbitrary social construct does not mean, however, that peoples’ race-based experiences are not real. Figure 2. [Images in clockwise order: Graham Crumb, https://tinyurl.com/7nwd3pvy, CC BY SA 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/4npnmepz; Ian Beatty, https://tinyurl.com/yc65txse, CC BY SA 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/4npnmepz; Erik Jacobs, https://tinyurl.com/2p8n47hh, CC BY 2.0, https://tinyurl.com/39uaces5; Abolfazl Eslami, https://tinyurl.com/5n6k4ftj, https://tinyurl.com/mrb5u7zv] Second, racial categories were developed with intentions that have fluctuated over time. Racial categorizations have played a key role in dictating which people are marginalized . For example, upon their arrival in the British colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish Catholic immigrants were initially racialized as non-White, working and living alongside free and enslaved Black people (Ignatiev, 2012; Garner, 2007). As Celts, the Irish were considered a less-developed, uncivilized race relative to Anglo-Saxons and faced wide-spread discrimination in this context. However, with a rising population of enslaved Africans and a need to easily distinguish enslaved from free laborers, it became useful to expand the definition of whiteness (Garner, 2007). In the United States, actively defining and redefining who could be considered racially ‘White’ (and free) fortified the racial hierarchy and ultimately cemented enslaved status as tied to Blackness. Modern ideas about race, in the Western world, have their foundations in histories of European imperialism and colonialism. European settlers came into (often violent) contact with communities that they deemed different in appearance and customs. Missionaries, slavers, and explorers commonly described darker-skinned “others” as uncivilized, barbaric, and otherwise culturally deficient in comparison to their European compatriots. The oppression of darker-skinned groups was often based on the assumed superiority of European language, intelligence, morality, beauty, and culture. Competitive pursuit of wealth among European nations accelerated the exploitation, enslavement, and genocide of non-European peoples across the globe (Guthrie, 2004). This process of deeming one’s own group as superior and another group as inferior to motivate and justify violence and colonization is not unique to European contexts, but its duration, extent, and lasting implications make it one of the most staggering examples. Third, there are instances where the historical legacy of racism continues to bear racist consequences today. Even when laws may have changed, traces of historical racism still remain. For example, the patterns of racially segregated housing in most major US cities that we see today map onto governmental policies that emerged in the 1910s and 20s to restrict where African Americans could live and buy homes (Rothstein, 2017). In South Africa, Apartheid (1940s-1990s) systematically denied non-White people access to most forms of capital, guaranteeing that South Africa would be controlled politically, socially, and economically by the nation’s minority White population. Despite the repeal of Apartheid laws and subsequent democratic elections, South African society still struggles with race-based inequalities in wealth, education, and health (National Research Council Panel on Race, Ethnicity, and Health in Later Life, 2004; WIDER & Oosthuizen, 2019). Bridging the Divide: Psychological Research on Perceiving and Denying Racism We have noted that people see racism in different lights. How should we understand such differences in perception of racism? Which psychological factors predict perceptions or denial of racism? Before we discuss a few key factors, we want to point out a tendency of people to focus explanations on groups we think do not fit a perceived norm (Hegarty & Pratto, 2001). Take for example, the caption of Figure 3 from a Pew Research Center report (2020) on views of racial progress in the United States. The caption, “Growing share of Black and Hispanic adults say the country hasn’t made enough progress on racial equality” follows a common tendency to explain differences in views as if it is the minoritized group that deviates from an unspoken norm. Yes, when you examine the data, there are increases between 2019 and 2020 in the number of Black and Hispanic adults who say the United States has not gone far enough in giving equal rights to Black Americans. However, the data show that the graph could also be titled, ‘White views that America’s racial progress has been just about right, remain stagnant’. This tendency to locate the source of group differences in racial “otherness” is, itself, a manifestation of racism of a sort that Thomas Teo (2010) has referred to as epistemological violence . Figure 3. [Image: Pew Research Center, tinyurl.com/4w9sxuwv, All Rights Reserved.] To avoid this, social psychologists suggest that we “turn the analytic lens” (Adams & Salter, 2007) and consider the flip side of the same coin. In this case, we should consider the topic from the standpoint of marginalized groups. The statistic that requires further explanation is the widespread belief that U.S. society has already done enough to attain racial equality. Claims about equality are not consistent with statistical evidence, which documents racial inequalities in education, employment, health, and income (e.g., American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Educational Disparities, 2012; U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). Instead, beliefs about racial equality reflect psychological processes that can facilitate underreporting of the extent of racism in US society. So, what are those psychological processes? Research has revealed two mechanisms through which under-reporting and denial of systemic racism tend to occur. The first—called “defensive motivations” — focuses on how acknowledging racism or other forms of oppression can pose a threat to one’s identity or worldview. The second—known as “foundations of knowledge”—focuses on the cultural information that forms people’s judgments. Defensive Motivations For an advantaged person to admit that racism is prominent in one’s society, they must acknowledge that, ultimately, they receive advantages from an illegitimate system (Jost, Banaji & Nosek, 2004; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). This acknowledgment can threaten one’s sense of personal self-worth or the worth of the group to which the person belongs, known as collective self-worth (O’Brien & Major, 2005). When one’s group is implicated by historical or contemporary wrong-doing, members of that group are motivated to deny that wrong-doing is ongoing, significant, or pervasive in order to maintain a positive view of one’s social group (e.g., Branscombe et al., 1999). For example, when researchers boosted White research participants’ sense of self-worth with positive self-statements, they were then more likely to perceive systemic racism than did participants in a control condition (Unzueta & Lowery, 2008; Adams, Tormala, & O’Brien, 2006). Outside of the U.S. context, researchers have also found that, after completing a self-affirmation task, Israeli participants were more willing to acknowledge the victimization of Palestinians and the Israeli participation in that victimization (Čehajić-Clancy et al., 2011). Opposition to acknowledging the extent to which racism operates in society can sometimes take the form of neutral claims on racism-relevant issues. For example, color-blind race ideology —the idea that people “do not see race”—can seem enlightened but, in practice, primarily serves the purpose of not “seeing” racism. Color-blind racial frames downplay the significance of ethnic and racial identity in peoples’ lived experiences and ignore the role of systemic oppression in impacting opportunities (e.g., Neville et al., 2013 ). Augoustinos and colleagues (2005) found that White Australians often used this principle to justify their opposition to anti-racism initiatives that would benefit Aboriginal people ( Augoustinos, Tuffin, & Every, 2005 ; see also Tuffin, 2008 ). Notably, they would dismiss the need for race-conscious policies that would address historical discrimination by suggesting that all people should be treated equally (and so Aboriginal people should not be given something “extra”), that people should be treated as individuals (and so Aboriginal people should not be treated as a group), and that White people have advanced through merit (thereby ignoring historically accumulated advantages). Foundations of Knowledge Beyond defensive motivations, there is another category of explanations for the tendency to minimize or deny racism. This category concerns the cultural knowledge that informs people’s judgments. A person’s cultural frame might lead to various conclusions about racism. Imagine, for example, an officer deciding to detain a person at the U.S.-Mexico border. Using a “racism as individual prejudice” framework, one might look toward features of the officer (i.e., how they feel about Mexicans) and conclude that without evidence of personal racial bias, the detention was simply the case of an officer applying the law in race-neutral fashion. In contrast, using a more systemic definition of racism, one might see the resulting detention as racially biased, regardless of the personal inclinations of an individual officer, because of the unequal and disparate impact of the policy itself. Consistent with this, researchers have found endorsements for harsher treatment of undocumented Mexican immigrants than undocumented Canadian immigrants, especially among White participants who equated being a true American with ethnocentric cultural values (e.g., being able to speak English without a “foreign” accent) (Mukherjee et al., 2013). Discretionary institutional policies that rely on ethno-racial profiling and mistreatment are forms of structural racism and everyday violence (Alexander, 2011). Another kind of cultural knowledge that facilitates or inhibits awareness of racism is collective memory about the role of past racism. Research on the Marley Hypothesis reveals that perceptions of racism are positively related to accurate historical knowledge (Bonam et al., 2019; Nelson, Adams, & Salter, 2013). In these studies, Black and White participants completed a “Black history” quiz that asked about historical events such as the U.S. government deliberately exposing black members of the military to syphilis, or hiding microphones in the hotel rooms of Civil Rights leaders. In the original study (Nelson et al., 2013) and in the replication (Bonam et al., 2019), White Americans scored lower on the measure of historical accuracy than did the Black Americans. Moreover, differences in knowledge of past racism helped explain Black and White differences in perception of present racism in U.S. society. Kurtiş and colleagues (2017) applied a similar research approach in Turkish contexts to further understand the relationship between critical historical knowledge about minority populations and policy support. They found that participants who demonstrated more accurate knowledge about officially silenced incidents of historical violence regarding minorities expressed greater support for protection of minority rights (Kurtiş, Soylu-Yalçınkaya, & Adams, 2017). Collective memory about racism is not only an individual-level phenomenon. What we know about historical events is embodied in cultural tools like textbooks, school curricula, government-sanctioned holidays, and memorials. Official government accounts of history tend to sanitize or silence the more negative or racist stories in order to maintain a positive view of a country’s past and present. For example, Moore (2020) analyzed Australian history textbooks from 1950-2010. She was interested in the idea of interest-convergence . Interest convergence suggests that White (or dominant group) engagement in racial progress emerges when it aligns with their own interests. Moore (2020) discovered that earlier textbooks were ‘loud and proud’ when highlighting supposed deficiencies in Aboriginal people and White exceptionalism. However, over time they were reframed in more subtle terms. For example, early Aboriginal sea voyages are sometimes dismissed as short, easy, and as employing primitive boats. Similarly, descriptions of hunting and gathering are framed to suggest that Aboriginal communities operated by survival instinct rather than making sophisticated, intentional, and cooperative community decisions. These explanations of Aboriginal culture are less overtly racist, but continue to set up the idea that White settlers in Australia brought more sophisticated technology, the rule of law, and other forms of “civilization.” Moore (2020) suggests that changes from overtly racist textbook narratives to more subtle forms are designed to affirm White racial progressiveness while still upholding White Supremacy. Consistent with these findings, research on how high schools in the U.S. discuss Black history revealed differences between predominantly Black and predominantly White schools (Salter & Adams, 2016). The researchers observed that predominantly White schools were more likely to present a version of Black history that promotes multicultural tolerance and diversity. Another notable strategy was to highlight individual Black American achievement—inventors, intellectuals, and Civil Rights heroes—while minimizing discussion of the historical barriers that these people faced. By contrast, predominantly Black schools were more likely to position Black history as accounts of the ongoing legacy of systemic exploitation and violent oppression. Cultural products, such as school curricula and textbooks, are not necessarily neutral accounts of what factually happened in the past; they reflect biases carried forward from the past and biases cultivated in the present. Psychological studies have also highlighted the consequences of being exposed to different foundations of knowledge. In the same line of research described above, Salter and Adams (2016) randomly assigned White American university students to view two distinct representations of Black History Month: those from predominantly White schools or those from predominantly Black schools. Their results indicate that exposure to representations of history from predominantly Black schools (which were more likely to contain narratives of historical racism) led to greater perceptions of racism and support for antiracist policies. Similarly, in a study by Bonam and colleagues (2019), White American participants listened to a clip of historian Richard Rothstein on NPR’s Fresh Air program discussing the federal government’s role in creating Black ghettos and the ongoing legacy of systemic racism in housing. The researchers found that listening to the clip increased critical history knowledge (in comparison to a control condition), increased beliefs about the government’s active role in creating Black ghettos, and, in turn, increased perceptions of systemic racism. Together, studies in this research program suggest how cultural representations of the past—what we might refer to as collective memory—matter for interpretation of the present. These studies also illuminate different sources of knowledge as important components for perceiving systemic racism. People who engage with representations of history that obscure past racism not only indicate a smaller role for racism as an explanation for contemporary events, but also express less support for reparative policies such as affirmative action than do people who engage with representations that acknowledge past racism. Before we move to the final section of the module, we would like you to pause and consider the links between the two mechanisms described in this section: motivation to view one’s self positively and information-based judgments of racism. Though we have presented them separately, they are related to each other. For example, Mukherjee and colleagues (2017) asked participants in India to rate historical events that either glorified India or acknowledged wrongdoing against marginalized groups. The nation-glorifying events were rated as more relevant and more important for the study of Indian history. Notably, exposure to glorifying themes about collective achievements in India produced higher national identification and exposure to critical narratives about collective wrongdoing decreased national identification. Thus, the two processes affect one another: certain information boosted the desire to view one’s group favorably and viewing one’s group favorably predicted the types of information a person prefers. Important to our discussion, exposure to critical narratives produced greater perceptions of injustice in India. By contrast, exposure to themes that glorified India lowered perceptions of injustice. Regardless of individual beliefs and biases, mainstream cultural tools influence people to approach the topic of racial justice in ways that serve national and dominant group interests. Implications for Action against Racism A major goal of this module has been to articulate a systemic approach to understanding racism. We end the module by discussing the implications of this approach for action against racism. We break our discussion into three distinct sections: 1) anti-racist research, 2) anti-racist practices and interventions, and 3) intersectional considerations. Anti-Racist Research As discussed above, standard psychological accounts of racism often suggest that it is a problem of biased individuals. This individualistic approach to racism is evident in research on the topic. Racism research often examines individual personality traits such as authoritarian personality or social justice orientation (see Noba’s Prejudice, Discrimination, and Stereotyping ). This approach to understanding racism leads to the idea that counteracting racism consists of measuring and altering personal qualities such as prejudice. As an example, one trend has involved the development of measures to identify people with implicit racist dispositions (e.g., Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). Another research trend has been to develop strategies that people might use to change their racist dispositions (Devine, Brodish, & Vance, 2005; Monteith, Ashburn-Nardo, Voils, & Czopp, 2002; Sassenberg & Moskowitz, 2005). Although research on individual factors in racism can reveal important insights, it may miss others. In contrast to an exclusive focus on individual dispositions, a systemic approach locates the roots of racism in social and cultural factors. This approach calls for research to examine the role that institutions, norms, laws, and policies play in racism. Table 1 lists examples of both individual and systemic questions about racism that researchers might ask. The systemic questions emphasize an attention to the interplay between individual and systemic oppression (see Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbett, 1998; Oakes, Haslam, & Turner, 1994). Addressing these questions requires the use of unique theoretical perspectives and empirical techniques that are relatively rare in psychological research (e.g., discourse analysis, decolonial approaches, critical race theory frameworks). These approaches have the potential to yield new insights because they are more likely to include the experiences and perspectives of racially marginalized people. Table 1. Anti-Racist Intervention Beyond its implications for research, a systemic approach to racism also suggests a shift in the emphasis of anti-racist interventions. Psychologists have typically framed the fight against racism as reducing individual prejudice or changing racist attitudes, and have designed effective programs to address this goal. Standard approaches to prejudice reduction seem to imply that the formerly racist individual, equipped with new attitudes, will now be anti-racist. In addition, this strategy implies that racially marginalized groups should accept a reduction of prejudice as a substitute for challenging the legacy of historical violence and the enduring, unjust status quo. A systemic approach to anti-racism, by contrast, proposes to change the societal structures that foster racist tendencies (Karpinski & Hilton, 2001). This direction suggests that people might better control automatic racist tendencies by disengaging from experiences that promote racism and, instead, cultivate experiences that reinforce anti-racist tendencies. For example, interventions that increase engagement with diversity may lead participants to seek out diverse social communities or conversations that can promote non-racist attitudes (see Gurin et al., 2008). The systemic approach to addressing racism also calls for dismantling racist structures that continue to cause harm, above and beyond the prejudices of any individual person. This includes challenging popular accounts of history; namely, progress narratives that promote the idea that society was once racist but now has overcome racism (Richeson, 2020). Such challenges emphasize: understanding the experiences of people who belong to historically marginalized groups exposing and reforming racist laws and institutional policies including alternative narratives of history that include the voices and understandings of marginalized communities raising awareness of privilege among members of dominant groups One example of work in this direction involves challenging traditional notions of merit (Croizet, 2008). Specifically, intelligence tests, college entrance exams, and other assessments of “ability” or “aptitude” have been used to discriminate against people of color. Although these types of tests often yield differences in scores between members of various racial groups, these differences do not suggest that members of dominant groups are smarter or have more potential. Instead, they reflect inequalities in test familiarity, test preparation and support, educational support, and similar factors. Other examples of challenging common attitudes involve challenging conceptions of fairness (Jones, 1998; Smith & Crosby, 2008), national identity (Gurin et al., 2008), and accounts of history (Sears, 2008; Yellow Bird, 2004). Intersectional Considerations One of the complicating factors in successfully addressing racism is intersectionality . Rooted in Black feminist scholarship and critical race theory, intersectionality is the idea that people’s lived experience of oppression is based on more than a single identity. Intersectional analyses consider the oppression that arises out of the combination of various forms of discrimination which produces something distinctive from any one form of discrimination alone. One of the earliest recorded accounts of intersectionality dates back to the 1851 Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio where a former slave, –Sojourner Truth– delivered her famous “Ain’t I a woman?” speech. In it, she provided an account of Black women born into slavery at the intersections of race and gender. In the 1990s, Kimberlé Crenshaw popularized the term intersectionality to describe the exclusion of Black women from feminist discourse (which equated women with White) and conversations about racism (which equated Black with men). Intersectionality situates experience within a complex web of power relations including dimensions such as race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, class, dis/ability, and sexuality (Anthias & Yuval-Davis, 1983; Crenshaw, 1989; Collins & Bilge, 2020 ; hooks, 2000; Hurtado, 1998). Attention to intersectionality can help us move beyond dichotomous formulations (e.g. us–them, oppressor–oppressed) to better appreciate the personal and cultural experiences that structure our everyday lives in distinct yet interrelated ways (Grewal & Kaplan, 2001). Intersectional analyses elevate the often-ignored experiences of people in marginalized identity positions ( Matsuda, 1 9 87 ). Accordingly, a primary contribution of intersectional analyses is to rethink standard accounts of knowledge (Kurtiş & Adams, 2016) and reimagine society from the perspective of those in marginalized positions. Conclusion Psychology has played a pivotal role in the struggle against racism since decades. Scholars have produced nuanced accounts about the dynamics of individual prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination. Yet, persisting inequalities and racism reveal that efforts at research, intervention, and education remain incomplete. In this module, we have proposed that one direction for action is a systemic approach to racism. From this perspective, racism is not an issue of biased individuals, but instead, a historically rooted and enduring cultural pattern embedded in everyday laws, policies, and social attitudes that can cause harm for people from oppressed groups. Racism can also create advantages for people from dominant groups, even if they are unaware of these benefits or have no personal intention to discriminate. Accordingly, anti-racist efforts require greater attention to multiple and intersecting systems of oppression. These efforts compel us to pay attention to both how environmental patterns of racism shape individual experience, but also processes by which even good-intentioned individuals can unknowingly reproduce systems of racism. Vocabulary Automatic Automatic biases are unintended, immediate, and irresistible. Aversive racism Aversive racism is unexamined racial bias that the person does not intend and would reject, but that avoids inter-racial contact. Blatant biases Blatant biases are conscious beliefs, feelings, and behavior that people are perfectly willing to admit, are mostly hostile, and openly favor their own group. Discrimination Discrimination is behavior that advantages or disadvantages people merely based on their group membership. Implicit Association Test Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures relatively automatic biases that favor own group relative to other groups. Model minority A minority group whose members are perceived as achieving a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average. Prejudice Prejudice is an evaluation or emotion toward people merely based on their group membership. Right-wing authoritarianism Right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) focuses on value conflicts but endorses respect for obedience and authority in the service of group conformity. Self-categorization theory Self-categorization theory develops social identity theory’s point that people categorize themselves, along with each other into groups, favoring their own group. Social dominance orientation Social dominance orientation (SDO) describes a belief that group hierarchies are inevitable in all societies and even good, to maintain order and stability. Social identity theory Social identity theory notes that people categorize each other into groups, favoring their own group. Stereotype Content Model Stereotype Content Model shows that social groups are viewed according to their perceived warmth and competence. Stereotypes Stereotype is a belief that characterizes people based merely on their group membership. Subtle biases Subtle biases are automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent, but real in their consequences. References Adams, G., & Salter, P. S. (2007).

Do not introduce new parent questions that have not appeared before.\n   - Each decomposition must map a `parent_q` to a list of `sub_questions`.\n   - You must provide a global `reason` explaining **why** decomposition is needed.\n   - Format:\n     ```json\n     {\n       "reason": "These questions require finer-grained analysis.",\n       "mapping": [\n         {\n           "parent_q": "How does climate change affect agriculture?",\n           "sub_questions": [\n             "How does temperature rise affect crop yield?",\n             "How does drought impact livestock?"\n           ]\n         },\n         {\n           "parent_q": "What are the social impacts of climate change?",\n           "sub_questions": [\n             "How does climate change affect migration patterns?",\n             "What mental health issues are linked to climate change?"\n           ]\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **final_answer**\n   - Use this only when you believe the question can be directly answered, either based on prior knowledge or based on the `<sub-answers>` returned by previous decompositions.\n   - Provide a `reason` explaining **why** a final answer can now be given.\n   - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n\n---\n\n## Observation Rules\n\n- You may receive a block like:\n  ```\n  <sub-answers>\n  [ ... structured list of sub-questions and their summarized answers ... ]\n  </sub-answers>\n  ```\n  This means earlier decomposed questions have been resolved. You should:\n  - Consider whether these provide enough context to synthesize a final answer.\n  - Or decide whether **further decomposition** is needed for any sub-question.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning Format\n\nFor every action:\n1. First, **explain your reasoning** clearly in natural language.\n2.

Refers to the unquestioned and unearned set of advantages, entitlements, benefits and choices bestowed on people solely because they are white. Generally white people who experience such privilege do so without being conscious of it. 2. Structural White Privilege : A system of white domination that creates and maintains belief systems that make current racial advantages and disadvantages seem normal. The system includes powerful incentives for maintaining white privilege and its consequences, and powerful negative consequences for trying to interrupt white privilege or reduce its consequences in meaningful ways. The system includes internal and external manifestations at the individual, interpersonal, cultural and institutional levels. The accumulated and interrelated advantages and disadvantages of white privilege that are reflected in racial/ethnic inequities in life-expectancy and other health outcomes, income and wealth, and other outcomes, in part through different access to opportunities and resources. These differences are maintained in part by denying that these advantages and disadvantages exist at the structural, institutional, cultural, interpersonal, and individual levels and by refusing to redress them or eliminate the systems, policies, practices, cultural norms, and other behaviors and assumptions that maintain them. Interpersonal White Privilege : Behavior between people that consciously or unconsciously reflects white superiority or entitlement. Cultural White Privilege : A set of dominant cultural assumptions about what is good, normal or appropriate that reflects Western European white world views and dismisses or demonizes other world views. Institutional White Privilege : Policies, practices and behaviors of institutions—such as schools, banks, non-profits or the Supreme Court—that have the effect of maintaining or increasing accumulated advantages for those groups currently defined as white, and maintaining or increasing disadvantages for those racial or ethnic groups not defined as white. The ability of institutions to survive and thrive even when their policies, practices and behaviors maintain, expand or fail to redress accumulated disadvantages and/or inequitable outcomes for people of color.

Now, we move to individual minds surrounded and shaped by these societal structures. Next, we then move to interacting minds, which further perpetuate societal and individual racial distinctions. Racial bias at each level supports bias at the other levels, creating a racist system. To understand individual mental structures, we start with unconscious inference, identified by Helmholtz, and its heir, implicit bias, most relevantly as expressed by Whites associating Black racial cues with negative concepts. Socially motivated (mis)perception goes one stage earlier to bias information seeking and interpretation. More specific links among racial bias in perceiving physiognomy, linked to dehumanizing associations, and aggressive behavior close this first section on the individual. Unconscious inference Among the intellectuals who contributed to the emergence of experimental psychology as an independent discipline in the nineteenth century was the German polymath, Herman von Helmholtz, whose numerous contributions to science include the concept of “ Unbewuste Schluss ” or “ unconscious inference .” Helmholtz’s concept was simple, but its implications are profound, even more so today with recent advances in the mind and brain sciences. Given the complexity of just the visual world, how are humans to represent it based on their individual-level, meager sensory and perceptual system, which entails the shunting of packets of data from the world outside, through the eyes and into the brain? Helmholtz offered two ideas. First, perception is not veridical, given the complexity of the world and the rudimentary nature of the minds attempting to make sense of it. Second, as implied by the word inference , what one deduces from the evidence provided by the senses is not a replica of what is out there. Rather, mental representations of the physical world are mere approximations. Whittling the self-esteem of Homo sapiens down further, Helmholtz went on to say that perception is not controllable, but rather that it unfolds automatically. He used a commonplace example to make this point. We know that it is not the Sun that rises, but rather that the Earth revolves around it. But when we sit on our porch at sunrise, and look toward the horizon, we incontrovertibly experience ourselves as being fixed, and the Sun, however bulky, pushing itself up to meet us. To say about the Sun that “it rises” is completely inaccurate yet completely compelling. That incorrect perception is not something over which we have choice. To think otherwise is to delude ourselves. Helmholtz’s two ideas contained in the phrase “unconscious inference,” with many additional levels of social complexity, summarizes the challenge when we confront systemic racism. On the one hand, we “know” the facts about an economy purportedly mounted on free labor for 250 years, the undelivered promise of 40 acres and a mule, the failure of Reconstruction, the resistance to desegregation, the history of redlining and gerrymandering, a history of unequal access to education, jobs, housing, finance, healthcare, and a lack of equal protection under the law. On the other hand, the limited sensory, perceptual, learning, and memory systems of humans set up a built-in blindness and automatic inferences that generate the illusions that, for instance, White people experience more discrimination than Black people (Norton & Sommers, 2011 ). Or, if Black Americans have any challenges, they have created their own situation in America today (Pettigrew, 1979 ) and therefore are responsible for getting themselves out of that situation. Not that minorities have no illusions, but the illusions of the higher-status group have more consequences because they usually also have more power. The features of human minds that feed into the production of systemic racism come in two forms: ordinary errors of perception, attention, learning, memory, and reasoning that are the hallmarks of all thinking systems with human-like intelligence. In addition, we add another level of theorizing familiar to psychologists, that of motivated reasoning , the idea that our preferences, goals, and desires can bias our reasoning and lead to prejudicial decisions and outcomes (Fiske & Taylor, 2021 ; Kunda, 1990 ). Another hallmark of human cognition is the phenomenon of loss aversion , the finding human beings much prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979 ). Even as White Americans resist and deny the reality of systemic racism, they nonetheless feel the loss of White privilege and social status quite keenly, creating powerful resentments that motivate them to reason away the potential existence of systemic racism (Craig & Richeson, 2014 ; Parker, 2021 ). Implicit racial bias Beginning in the 1980s, psychologists began to document a puzzling result. Individuals who claimed to have no racial animus showed evidence of negative attitudes and stereotypes toward Black Americans (Devine, 1989 ; Dovidio & Gaertner, 1986 ). Soon, the hunt for methods to better access “implicit bias” (as contrasted with standard, explicit bias measured in surveys) was underway, with specific calls for the invention of better technologies that could bypass conscious awareness or conscious control (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995 ). One such measure, the Implicit Association Test (IAT), has demonstrated a wide array of group evaluative associations. Typically, people can pair own-group cues faster with positive concepts, and other-group cues faster with negative ones—compared with vice versa. For example, White and other non-Black Americans show robust race bias in their inability to associate “good” and “bad” equally rapidly with the social categories Black and White. The IAT has attracted considerable attention (see Greenwald et al., 2020 , for best practices, reliable effects, and ongoing investigations). A public online location, since 1998, has provided data from millions of tests taken by volunteer participants at http://www.implicit.harvard.edu . Several signature results have replicated multiple times with large samples over time: (a) Race bias is consistently visible in the data. (b) A small positive correlation between stated and implicit race attitudes exists, but the two are largely dissociated, i.e., many of those who report being neutral (no negative explicit attitudes toward Black or White Americans), do carry implicit associations of Black + bad and White + good to a larger extent than White + bad and Black + good. This result prompts us to yet again note that the term “racism” has been used by contemporary psychologists to refer to conscious forms of race prejudice and to emphasize its semi-independence from less conscious or implicit forms of race bias. To make this distinction clear, researchers who study implicit race bias have gone to great lengths to reserve the term racism to only refer to conscious expressions of racial animus. Our usage of the term systemic racism in this article is undertaken is in the interest of including all levels of analysis (individual, institutional, societal) and all forms, from the most explicit to the most implicit. The result of a low correlation between explicit racism and implicit race bias makes the point empirically that the two are not the same. Of course, implicit race bias feeds into what may become racism, and for this reason it is best to think about implicit race bias as the roots of racism, not the above ground, visible structure. Implicit race bias also results from systemic racism. (c) Asian Americans show the same pattern as White Americans, even though as a third-party group in response to a Black–White test, they might be assumed to have neutrality. From the point of view of systemic racism, this is an example of what it means to live in a system of inequity at all levels. Even third-party groups will acquire negative and positive attitudes toward groups that are not their own. (d) Black Americans express strong positive feelings toward their own group but on the measure of implicit cognition, they show no preference for their own group, with scores of almost any sample of Black Americans showing relative neutrality, i.e., equal association of good and bad for Black and White Americans. This absence of ingroup-favoring attitudes—juxtaposed with the ingroup-favoring lack of neutrality in all other groups in the same society—is open to various interpretations, from moral balance to internalized racism to astute pragmatism; all await other data. (e) Tests of anti-gay bias revealed it to be quite high in 2007 but steadily dropping off (by 64% since 2013) to be at an all-time low today. By comparison, anti-Black bias has dropped, but to a much lesser extent, by about 25% (Charlesworth & Banaji, in press). A 25% drop-off in race bias is not insignificant, and although the genders differ in magnitude of bias, both men and women are losing bias at equal speed. Although all demographic groups are changing, young Americans are changing faster than older Americans, suggesting that the world they inhabit is signaling a less biased set of attitudes. Together, these data point to the individual manifestation of systemic racial bias, hidden from view but robustly present. However, psychologists have also gone beyond such demonstrations of basic cognitive associations as markers of implicit mental content to show that individual and institutional change is possible if the will to create change exists. Socially motivated (mis)perception The idea of motivated reasoning or motivated cognition gathers several useful ideas to understand how individual humans shape and even distort perception to deal with real or perceived threats to self. Kunda ( 1990 ), for example, posited that the individual need for accuracy is thwarted by the demand to reach a conclusion prior to the evidence being satisfactorily in place and that one’s goals and motives often drive decisions. These decisions reveal many identifiable biases that emerge to weaken the orientation toward accuracy (see Fiske & Taylor, 2021 ). With more direct focus on motivated reasoning as it concerns social change, Kay et al., ( 2009 ) presented empirical evidence for a motivated tendency to view things as they are and conclude that such a state of affairs exists because it is reasonable and even representative of how things ought to be. The connection to systemic racism is quite clear, as the authors further demonstrate that motivated cognition exists in the interest of justifying sociopolitical systems that maintain inequality and resist change. People justify the status quo, preferring stability especially if they are privileged, but even if not (Jost & Banaji, 1994 ). Groups in a secure position show the cultural equivalent of inertia, seeking stability, but groups on the move express inertia as continuing to move (e.g., acquiring mainstream standing) (Zárate et al., 2019 ). Two substantive theoretical accounts undergird these ideas as they concern complex interactions of within-person and across-person phenomena such as systemic racism. First, Sidanius and Pratto’s ( 1999 ) Theory of Social Dominance offers evolutionary and cultural evidence to support the idea that hierarchies are an almost obligatory feature of human social groups. A related but independent idea may be found in Jost’s System Justification Theory (Jost, 2020 ), which explicitly makes the case that individuals will sacrifice self and group interest in order to maintain larger “systems” of social arrangements and work to keep them in place. The reason, Jost argues, is that such a motivation serves to meet deep psychological needs for certainty, security, and acceptance by others. The overarching social structure is important to protect because if it is stable, then all within it will be safe, including those disadvantaged by established hierarchies. Perception of phenotypes, deadly associations, and system-maintaining behavior With regard to perceptions of race, the mere categorization of someone as Black shifts perceptions of their phenotype. For example, a series of experiments documented that people’s knowledge about race phenotypes drives perception of lightness of the skin tone (Levin & Banaji, 2006 ). In other words, experiments held skin-tone constant and varied only the features, from Afrocentric to Eurocentric; this variation in features shifts perception of skin tone, such that Afrocentric faces are viewed to be darker skinned than Eurocentric ones, despite the same gray-scale tone. Skin tone and features are critical cues to make life and death decisions, especially in ambiguous situations that are often present in so many interactions between police and Black citizens. In simulations of police-citizen encounters, people are more likely to “shoot” unarmed Black men than otherwise equally unarmed White men (Correll, Wittenbrink, Park, Judd, & Goyle, 2010 ). Black men with more phenotypically Black features are more likely to receive the death penalty for murdering a White person, holding constant the features of the crime (Eberhardt, 2019 ). The phenotypicality effect extends even to Whites with Afrocentric features (Blair, Judd, & Chapleau, 2004 ). Judgments of criminality can be primed by a Black face (Eberhardt, 2019 ). And there’s more: the race–crime association overlaps the dehumanizing association of Black faces with great ape faces, that Staples ( 2018 ) called the “racist trope that won’t die”; Goff, Eberhardt, Williams and Jackson ( 2008 ) provide evidence from policing that links apes and Black people, from the first moments of perception to the radio dispatch and other media, with systemic implications. In more recent work, Morehouse et al., ( 2021 ) have shown that White Americans associate White with human and Black, Asian, and Latinx with animal with greater ease than the opposite pairing (White with animal), regardless of the category of animal (generic or specific). Implicit racial biases (Whites favoring Whites) are consequential, correlating with judged trustworthiness and economic investment (Stanley, Sokol-Hessner, Banaji & Phelps, 2011 ). More recently, Kurdi et al., ( 2021 ) measured attitudes toward a phenotypic feature that happens to be a dominant perceptual marker of race, Afrocentric and Eurocentric types of hair. First participants took an IAT measuring their implicit attitude toward Black women with natural or straightened hair. Then, subjects read a summary of a real legal case involving a corporation that fired a Black employee for refusing to change her natural hair ( Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Catastrophe Management Solutions , 2016). The more negative the implicit attitude toward Afrocentric hair, the greater the sympathy with the corporation’s position rather than the plaintiff’s position in the legal case. A relatively new approach to racial associations comes with the promise of epitomizing the term “systemic” in systemic racism. These are studies of large language corpora that are now possible using machine learning approaches to natural language. With the increasing availability of trained datasets—including large samples of the language of the Internet (content archives continuously collected by the nonprofit Common Crawl) or specific trained datasets of media such as books, TV shows, etc.—allow measuring the extent to which language contains attitudes and beliefs about Black and White Americans across time. Charlesworth and Banaji (in preparation) analyzed data from Google Books from 1800 to 1990. Setting aside the data from older books to focus on whether bias is present in the language today, these are the traits most associated with Black Americans (and not with White Americans) in the late twentieth century: earthy, lonely, sensual, cruel, lifeless, deceitful, meek, rebellious, headstrong, lazy . By contrast, these are the traits associated with White Americans (and not with Black Americans): critical, decisive, hostile, friendly, polite, able, diplomatic, belligerent, understanding, confident . Other work in natural language processing (NLP) sorts adjectives into 13 stereotype-content dictionaries (Nicolas, Bai, & Fiske, 2021 ). The above adjectives convey ambivalent reactions to Black Americans on several dimensions, but notably neglect competence; Whites in contrast feature several competence adjectives. NLP allows efficient analysis of language in the culture or in spontaneous, open-ended descriptions (Nicolas, Bai, & Fiske, under review). Footnote 4 Words have an important role to play. People often express surprise about implicit biases in the minds of individuals who have no intent to harbor them. Considering how and why it occurs—plausible mechanisms—may prove convincing. One causal candidate is language , the predominant way humans communicate and express themselves. Words undertake much of the labor of creating racism in thoughts and feelings that are reflected in speech. Machine learning approaches to understanding racial bias in language will likely be a critical method to objectively uncover how words, spoken and written, create systemic racism. That is, linguistic patterns connect groups with valenced concepts, and the repeated pairings create associations. Without awareness, language produces the inbuilt in the architecture of social cognition (as an example, the NLP stereotype-dimensions dictionaries capture more than 80% of spontaneous stereotype content; Nicolas, Bai, & Fiske, under review). From cognitive racial bias to aggregate racialized behavior Individual implicit attitudes have been repeatedly shown to predict behavior; Kurdi et al. ( 2019 ) offer the largest number of studies included in a meta-analysis to date. However, as the authors note, the actual attitude–behavior relationship is marred by the poor quality of many studies, especially given the lack of psychometric control over the predicted behavior. Among the controversies that have marked this work is an intriguing idea put forth by Payne, Vuletich and Lundberg ( 2017 ), who proposed that the small correlations between individual attitude and behavior must be acknowledged as a function of what they call the “bias of crowds,” the idea that an individual’s behavior is determined by the larger social context in which that individual exists. A number of studies have appeared recently to challenge the idea that individual attitude–behavior correlations is the right place to be looking. That the actual correlation between implicit attitude and behavior is larger than it may have appeared has been revealed in a series of studies that predict behavior at the aggregate level by using aggregate IAT scores by region, such as metropolitan areas, counties, and states. Charlesworth and Banaji ( 2021 ) reviewed these studies to demonstrate more substantive relationships between IAT racial bias and consequential social outcomes. For example, the studies reviewed reveal that the greater the implicit bias against Blacks in a region (using average IAT scores of a region) the greater is the lethal use of force by police, the greater the Black American deaths from circulatory diseases, the lower is spending on Medicaid disability programs (more likely to assist Black Americans), the greater the Black–White gap in infant low birth weight and preterm births, the greater the Black–White gap in school disciplining (suspension, law enforcement referrals, expulsions, in-school arrests), the Black–White gap in standardized testing scores (3rd–8th grade for math and English), and lower upward mobility. To grasp the meaning of systemic racism as it exists at the individual level within larger society, not just in a single moment by across time, a study by Payne, Vuletich and Brown-Iannuzzi ( 2019 ) is illustrative. Their analysis of IAT data today yields strong correlations with the ratio of enslaved to free people in the southern US in 1860. States with a larger ratio in 1860 are the states with greater race bias today, 160 years later (r = 0.64). This correlation is much larger in magnitude than even the correlation between regional IAT race bias and Black American representation across the US (r = 0.32). As Charlesworth and Banaji ( 2021 ) note, “the result also suggests that today’s Americans who live in regions with greater historical legacies of slavery must be acquiring the particles of race bias embedded in the social atmosphere. Systemic discrimination is a useful term in this case as it helps capture the pervasiveness of race bias as it extends across both space and time.” Summary. As explicit bias decreased, measured forms of implicit bias have persisted, potentially attributable to racial segregation. White Americans have limited direct experience with Black Americans, so cultural associations substitute for more individuated impressions. Implicit associations of “Black-bad” and “White-good” are weakening, but far from neutral. Meanwhile, socially motivated (mis)perception favors these system-justifying biases. Together, they support a syndrome linking racial phenotypes, deadly associations, and system-maintaining behavior. Further, cognitive racial biases underpin aggregate racialized behavior. These are some cognitive-motivational mechanisms of systemic racism. Other mechanisms involve everyday interactions that perpetuate bias. In particular, predictable patterns of disrespect and distrust maintain the interpersonal racial divide. Racialized social interactions Face-to-face behavior propagates bias. Individuals carry racial biases into their social settings largely by interacting with others. Repeated patterns of behavior that differ by race are, at a minimum, racialized (defined by race) and often experienced as racist. Individual racial biases, enacted in daily life, perpetuate bias, which then links the individual to the norms, scripts, and habits that constitute the social system. Interpersonal interaction conveys bias, intentionally or not. In scores of studies, White Americans distance themselves from Black interaction partners, express non-verbal discomfort, and avoid them (e.g., Dovidio, Kawakami & Gaertner, 2002 ; Richeson & Shelton, 2007 ; Word, Zanna & Cooper, 1974 ). In the aggregate, these patterns constitute the concrete manifestations of a racially biased social system. We have already seen White people’s generically negative default associations with Black Americans, linking them to crime (untrustworthy) and to animals (incompetent). These reflect the two key stereotype dimensions in intergroup perception (Fiske, 2018 ): warmth and competence. These dimensions organize people’s perceptions of social systems: perceived competence reflects groups’ stereotypic status in society. The hierarchy supposedly reflects merit, so rank predicts their supposed competence and evokes respect—or supposed incompetence and disrespect. Besides groups’ status (competence), the other aspect of social structure is groups’ apparent cooperative or competitive goals, interdependencies that stereotypically predict warmth and trustworthiness. Cooperators on our side are nice; competitors are not. Stereotypes derive from social structural perceptions (status and interdependence), especially when people learn about others they might encounter (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick & Xu, 2002 ; Nicolas et al., 2021 ). Black Americans do not get a break on either dimension. And because these racialized perceptions derive from social structure, they pave the way for systemic racism. Consider the evidence for these two dimensions: competence and warmth in racialized perceptions and behavior. Disrespect communicates Whites’ view of Blacks as low status and incompetent The default representation of Black Americans is low status (Dupree, Torrez, Obioha & Fiske, 2021 ). Whites spontaneously associate Black faces with low-status jobs, compared to Whites. The structural belief that Blacks are low status appears in associating them with jobs such as janitor, dishwasher, garbage collector, taxi driver, cashier, maid, prostitute. This race–status association correlates with endorsing social dominance (believing that some groups inevitably dominate others, and it is better that way) and with meritocracy (group get what they deserve). All these judgments share a common element of disrespect and assumed incompetence. Race–status associations emerge in behavior that maintains Black people at the bottom of the hierarchy. Respondents endorsed Black applicants for lower status jobs and withheld support for organizations and government policies aiding minorities. Thus, racialized associations, assumptions, and preferences all identify a view of Black people\'s structural position as low status, on average. Behavior communicates these attitudes, whether examined or not. Thus, race–status associations imply Black incompetence, covarying with feeling-thermometer (0–100) ratings of interracial bias, social dominance orientation, meritocracy beliefs, as well as hierarchy-maintaining hiring and policy preferences. Disrespectful behavior that presumes incompetence of Blacks appears in another series of studies. Well-meaning liberals, expected to introduce themselves to a Black partner, dumbed-down their speech, as they did in vocabulary for a task assignment (Dupree & Fiske, 2019 ). Similarly, White Democratic presidential candidates also showed a competence downshift in speeches to minority audiences only (Dupree & Fiske, 2019 ). This pattern reproduces itself when respondents imagine introducing themselves to a lower-status person (race unspecified) at work (Swencionis & Fiske, 2016 ). They claim their goal is to communicate their own warmth (as they downplay their competence), but this rests on the presumption of the other’s incompetence. Trying to be folksy does not communicate respect. The presumption that structural status predicts competence is widespread (averaging r > 0.80 across US and international samples; Fiske & Durante, 2016 ). The implication is that for most White Americans, the association that pops into their minds will link a Black person with incompetence. People communicate such disrespect by failing to bet on or invest in the other’s performance (Walsh, Vaida, & Fiske, under review). Structurally, this amounts to racism. Black people are widely perceived as inferior in these ways, which are baked into the social hierarchy, reflecting disrespectful patterns of interpersonal behavior. All of this perpetuates the social hierarchy and the image of Blacks as incompetent. Worse yet, disrespect surfaces in police encountering Black drivers. From the first moment (“Hey” instead of “Sir” or “Ma’am”), police officer language shows computationally derived, measurably lower respect (Voigt et al., 2017 ). Given the already fraught relationships between police and Black community members, this worsens an already dangerous encounter and undermines the chances to create trust. Distrust communicates Whites’ views of Blacks as uncooperative and not warm Besides incompetence, the other major dimension of social cognition is warmth (trustworthy, friendly), as noted. The default stereotype of a Black person is probably also untrustworthy, but the data on this point are surprisingly indirect. Whites can be expected to distrust Blacks as part of the larger principle that, categorically, people mistrust outgroups. More specifically, as noted, Whites associate Blacks with crime, which certainly undermines trust. Footnote 5 This configuration fits survey data showing that ratings of poor (i.e., explicitly low-status) Black people allege incompetence (disrespecting them) but also lack of warmth (distrusting them). Plotting these ratings in a warmth x competence space, poor Blacks are frequently judged as low on both. Because White Americans link race and status, the low-income Black person is the default Black person, allegedly incompetent, but also untrustworthy. Mistrust is indicated by excessive surveillance of Black Americans (driving while Black, shopping while Black, false accusations of theft or assault, police shootings…). Footnote 6 Distrust can be operationalized as behavior: In the economic Trust Game, a player must decide how much of their starting endowment to share, on the knowledge that it will be tripled, and on the hope that their partner will share back, generously. Incentivized trust-game behavior closely tracks warmth ratings; that is, societal groups rated as low warmth and untrustworthy receive less shared endowment, presumably because they are not trusted to share it back. In nationally representative samples, people of color do not fare well in the Trust Game (Walsh et al., under review). In more prosaic settings, non-verbal behavior reveals unmonitored dislike (if not specifically mistrust), as noted. Black Americans experience repeated treatment as incompetent and untrustworthy. Because this stereotype and ensuing behavior is racially category-based and negative, as well as potentially controllable, it is racist. Because the behavior comes from societal stereotypes, which come from social structure, Footnote 7 it is systemic. Whites’ potential control implies responsibility for reinforcing system racism Racialized interactions could also be termed racist, in the sense that White people could potentially observe their own inequitable behavior if they chose (Fiske, 1989 ). People rarely examine these unwritten rules, typical behaviors, but conceivably they could, so “unexamined” bias captures the higher potential control for behavior than for implicit associations. Control implies responsibility in the minds of lay people and the law, so this interpretation of “racialized” as “racist” creates concern and is likely to be contested. But the science makes the empirical point here that racialized social behavior is demonstrably controllable, given sufficient incentive (Monteith, Lybarger & Woodcock, 2009 ; Sinclair, Lowery, Hardin & Colangelo, 2005 ). So systematically different behavior by race reflects a racist habit, script, or norm, the components of a system from the bottom up. The challenge in controlling racist habits is that they are the cultural default. Much of this systematic behavior results from White Americans’ inexperience with Black Americans, thereby substituting societal representations for individuating information about the unique human (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990 ). People use especially those default representations that fit their natural human tendency to detect and prefer people they view as similar to themselves. To unpack this, consider some basic principles of affiliation that would predispose Whites to favor other Whites and exclude Black people. First is the basic tendency to categorize others and to favor those of the ingroup. For decades, principles of attraction have established its foundations in similarity (Byrne, 1971 ; Montoya & Horton, 2013 ) or homophily (McPherson, Smith-Lovin & Cook, 2001 ). And mere categorization suffices to produce ingroup favoritism (Tajfel & Turner, 1979 ). No animus is necessary, although it easily develops. As a basis for categorization, race is arbitrary (more so than gender and age; Kurzban, Tooby & Cosmides, 2001 ) but common (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999 ). Thus, race-based ingroup favoritism is a default, in the absence of other experience. Footnote 8 This makes it hard to over-ride. Societal segregation by race makes difficulties for overcoming the racial default. Segregation limits White exposure to Blacks, undermining their direct experience, leaving Whites to rely on cognitive shortcuts to represent Blacks as a group. Indeed, the less exposure people have to outgroups, the more clearly they differentiate among them–stereotypically. That is, White Americans who know the least about other races have the clearest stereotypes about them; the less diversity, the more differentiated their cognitive representations (Bai, Ramos & Fiske, 2020 ). What’s wrong with that? As a scientific question, a skeptic might ask, what’s wrong with differentiating by stereotypes? One set of answers concerns the demeaning individual and face-to-face interaction, just addressed. The other answers pertain to sheer demographic diversity of Black Americans, covered next. Given its racial history and ongoing systems, societal patterns and cultural stereotypes prevailing in the US tend to associate Blacks with low status and Whites with high status as noted. To the extent this race–status association has a kernel of statistical accuracy (Blacks are over-represented in low-status jobs), it fails several tests as an argument for using stereotypes as a constructive strategy of intergroup relations. First, it ignores variability, individuality, and (especially) Black diversity. Second, category-based thinking exaggerates perceived between-group variability and minimizes perceived within-group variability (Tajfel & Turner 1979 ; Taylor, Fiske, Etcoff & Ruderman, 1978 ). So “nouns that cut slices” (Allport’s, 1954 felicitous phrase for category labels) do violence to the human data. What’s more, society has civil rights laws protecting people from being judged by their group membership, so the consensus is that this is not only wrong, but illegal. Race–status associations, in practice, ignore all the structural contributors to race–status associations, such as the neighborhood effects, already described. Whites assume meritocracy, believing that status accurately reflects individual competence (Fiske, Dupree, Nicolas & Swencionis, 2016 ); globally, the perceived status—perceived competence correlation hovers around 0.80. (The only countries where people are more cynical about the status-merit link are former Communist ones; Grigoryan et al., 2020 .) The point here is that status has many antecedents, and not all of them are merit (or other personal, stereotypical explanations, e.g., innately good/bad at math). Systemic factors such as neighborhood, school, family resources, connections, and especially race all receive no mention in the meritocracy account. Whites do differentiate Black Americans by subcategories, e.g., by status, specifically social class, viewing low-income Black people as incompetent and untrustworthy, but Black professionals as competent and trustworthy (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick & Xu, 2002 ). Black Americans themselves differentiate several subtypes of Blacks likewise along a social-class dimension (Fiske, Bergsieker, Russell & Williams, 2009 ). Status-keeping shortcuts are easier to maintain without information to the contrary, such as experiencing human variability. Whites with less exposure to Blacks are more overtly prejudiced as a function of structural features such as rural residence, where they encounter less diversity (Bai et al., 2020 ), and lack of education, where they experience less variability of ideas. As a structural matter, segregated White rural residence also predicts lower school quality partly because of the American policy of locally funding schools; this creates an association between a weaker tax base, rural location, ethnic homogeneity, and overt bias. These systemic factors interact to produce prejudice. As an earlier section shows, the social structure permeates American arrangements since the arrival of Whites on native lands. Nevertheless, for most Whites, their isolated lives make them inexperienced about their Black fellow citizens. Housing segregation disfavors most Whites in experience with diversity, making them often inept and naïve when speaking about issues that are facts of Black lives. This means that Whites rely on cultural shortcuts to understand the Black people whose life experience they do not know. These cognitive representations derive from perceived structural patterns such as race–status associations and race-resource unfairness (Krysan & Crowder, 2017 ). We have seen that Whites’ racial beliefs are relatively automatic (implicit bias) and ambivalent (warmth/competence). The resulting associations (stereotypes) are more subtle than most people believe. They are consequently hard for anyone to detect in themselves (unexamined) or in any one person (under the radar), but the patterns appear systemically as aggregate biases. Supposing the aggregate biases are problematic, at least because they ignore variability, examine that more closely. Aggregate bias ignores diversity So far, this review has described the relentless systems of racism that limit opportunity and outcomes by race. Many Black Americans nevertheless succeed despite the rigged system. Black diversity thus results from those who escape the system, but also from African and Caribbean immigration, and from intermarriage. For Black students enrolled at selective colleges, especially, the diversity of their backgrounds is the main fact that underscores their success (Charles, Kramer, Massey & Torres, 2021 ). Any given White student’s background is far more predictable than any given Black student’s, which potentially ranges from extreme disadvantage to extreme wealth. For that minority (a third) of Black students whose segregated neighborhoods entail underfunded schools, gang violence, and concentrated police violence, their presence in college testifies to extraordinary resilience (Charles, Fischer, Mooney & Massey, 2009 ). Most non-Black people do not realize that Black Americans are more diverse than most American ethnic groups. Underestimating their variety allows an oversimplified image to dominate every level, from mind to society, making it a systemic racism. This section describes diversity based on place, intermarriage, immigrant experience, parent education, and sheer escape. A century ago, most Black Americans lived in the rural South, but after the Great Migration, most lived in cities, often in the North, usually hyper-segregated, but with family roots in both the North and South. By the turn of the current century, Black American student bodies at selective colleges were the most diverse in history, more biracial, more immigrant, more middle or upper class, and equally identifying themselves as both American and as Black (Charles et al., 2021 ). Black students, even as elites, show “unprecedented variation in terms of racial origins, skin tone, nativity, generation, class, and segregation” (Charles et al., 2021 , Ch. 10). Clusters of characteristics and attitudes illustrate the variety. Mixed-race students identify less with being Black, are comfortable with both Blacks and Whites, see Whites as less discriminatory, and report deep parental involvement in their schooling and cultural experiences. Mixed race students also have more White friends and fewer Black friends than their monoracial peers and are more likely to date outside the group, especially with Whites. In addition, mixed-race students are less likely to join majority-Black organizations on campus, and thus report less intense interaction with Blacks . Psychologically, the White view of biracial individuals continues to demonstrate hypodescent, i.e., the view that biracial individuals belong to the less advantaged group, or the cognitive expression of the “one drop rule.” Combining the sociological and psychological angle demonstrates the lack of consistency between how biracial Americans are viewed and the way they see themselves. Black students with an immigrant background are most comfortable with other Black students, and report having strict parents who expect obedience, respect, hard work, and family loyalty without hands-on, hovering involvement. First-generation immigrants, especially African immigrants (versus Caribbean ones), believe in meritocracy and see Whites as not so discriminatory. After a generation, idealism gives way to pragmatism: Hard work pays off. African immigrant origins predict reliably higher grades. As for segregation, Black students growing up with more exposure to Whites feel closer to them but also view Whites as more discriminatory, a psychologically complex mental state to manage. In contrast, living in segregated neighborhoods especially exposes Black students to higher (the top third) levels of disorder and violence, leading them to view Whites as more distant and discriminatory. But parents are more protective, relying on strict discipline but not trying to use shame or guilt as an influence strategy (more frequent in Asian families). As with all students, high-school GPA predicts college GPA. Besides that, again as with all students, Black women do better than Black men, as do those with educated parents . Differences in academic preparation vary by segregation in two ways: the more White students in their schools, the worse Black students’ grades but the higher their SATs, suggesting more rigorous standards. Thus, the portraits of Black college students are diverse; generalizations are unreliable, except perhaps for one: resilience in the face of systemic bias and a diversity of adaptations to a variety of challenges. We document Black diversity here for these reasons: First, to avoid making the litany of systemic Black disadvantages the sole image conveyed here. Second, because of segregation, many White people, including University faculty, see a Black person on campus and—assuming they realize this is a student—they presume the person comes from a low-income background, unprepared for college, with uneducated parents, native born, but with little experience outside the imagined ghetto, etc. This may be true for some small fraction of students, but not just the Black ones, and not true of most Black students on campus today. A third reason to remind the reader of Black diversity on campus is to highlight experiences of inter-racial contact as important one mechanism for overcoming racial bias, and—if scaled up to integrated neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces—for shifting systemic racism. Contact: exposure to racial diversity People with least exposure to diversity have the most differentiated images of the outgroups they have never met (Bai et al., 2020 ). And the prospect and first experience of diversity is not salutary; newly diverse contexts show lower well-being (Putnam, 2007 ; Ramos, Bennett, Massey & Hewstone, 2019 ). But over time, people get used to each other: well-being is higher and stereotypes melt into each, forming an undifferentiated cluster of people like us, mostly warm and competent. Psychology has 70 years of research to explain how this works, following Allport’s ( 1954 ) contact hypothesis. In one meta-analytic perspective (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006 ), intergroup contact reduces prejudice, the more it meets Allport’s conditions: shared goals, non-trivial interactions, authority sanctions, and rewarding results. Much of the process seems to be affect-driven. If the contact setting would afford the opportunity for friendship, the contact effect is stronger (Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005 ). This is a useful reminder that much prejudice is emotional, not cognitive. In fact, a meta-analysis of 50 years of research on racist attitudes found that they predict racist behavior the most when they are emotions (“hating them”) rather than stereotypes (“they are lazy”) or even simple evaluations (2 on a 5-point scale) (Talaska et al., 2008 ). Nevertheless, the core element of successful contact, goal interdependence, does operate via information processing. In laboratory experiments, interdependence makes people attend specifically to unexpected, stereotype-inconsistent information, and they make dispositional inferences, generating an individualized coherent impression of the teammate (Ames & Fiske, 2013 ; Erber & Fiske, 1984 ). Neural signatures of mindreading prominently include the mPFC regions that reliably activate when people are inferring another’s predispositions. The mind-reading mPFC activates most for an interdependent partner’s stereotype-inconsistent attributes. Although supporting evidence includes these mechanisms, a subsequent meta-analysis (Paluck, Porat, Clark & Green, 2021 ) notes that few high-quality intergroup studies have focused on race per se, few look at adults, few are experiments. We have much to learn."}]'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

The starkest divides are in measures of household wealth, reflecting centuries of white privilege that have made it particularly difficult for people of color to achieve economic security. This series of charts begins with a look at how the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequalities. Racial Wealth Divide By the middle of the 21st century, the United States will be a “majority minority” nation. If we hope to ensure a strong middle class, historically the backbone of the national economy, then improving the financial health of households of color will become even more urgent than it is today. Closing the persistent “wealth divide” between white households and households of color, already a matter of social justice, must become a priority for broader economic policy. Public policies that favor white Americans and the wealthy have perpetuated both an extreme concentration of wealth and an extreme racial wealth divide. White households, Federal Reserve data show, held 84.2 percent of all U.S. wealth as of the fourth quarter of 2023, while making up only 66 percent of households. By contrast, Black families accounted for 11.4 percent of households and owned 3.4 percent of total family wealth, while Hispanic families represented 9.6 percent of households and owned 2.3 percent of total family wealth. These wealth figures include the value of consumer durable goods, such as vehicles. The racial wealth divide, according to Survey of Consumer Finances data, has narrowed slightly since 1989, but remains extremely wide. The median Black family has a net worth (including cars and other durable goods) of $44,100, just 15.5 percent of the $282,310 median white wealth. The typical Latino family, with $62,120, owns just 21.8 percent of the wealth of the median white family. The Institute for Policy Studies report, Ten Solutions to Bridge the Racial Wealth Divide , offers proposals for bold, structural reforms to address this problem. Families that have zero or even “negative” wealth (meaning the value of their debts exceeds the value of their assets) live on the edge, just one minor economic setback away from tragedy. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Federal Reserve data show that while the racial wealth gap has improved slightly, an estimated 28 percent of Black households and 26 percent of Latino households had zero or negative wealth in 2019, twice the level of whites. As with total wealth, home ownership is heavily skewed towards white families, our 2023 report with the National Community Reinvestment, Still a Dream , shows. Between 1960 and 2020, the rate of Black home ownership increased but the gap in ownership rates between Black and white families widened, from 26 percentage points to 30. Structural barriers, including lower incomes, higher rates of mortgage denials, and racial segregation, deny many Black families the opportunity to acquire this wealth-building asset. Black people also have to deal with larger student debt burdens. Black students on average have to take out larger loans to get through college than their white peers. A National Center for Education Statistics study reveals that Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree graduates face 13 percent and 26 percent more student debt, respectively, than their white peers. The challenge of paying off greater student debt is also worsened for Black graduates due to their lower average incomes. Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree holders earn 27 percent and 14 percent lower incomes , respectively, than whites with the same degree. Racial Income Inequality In 2021, Fortune 500 CEOs, who earned $18.3 million on average, included just four Black and 17 Latino people — just 4 percent of the total. By contrast, these groups made up 43 percent of the U.S. workers who would benefit from a raise in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, according to Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Economic Policy Institute data. Black and Latino people comprise 31 percent of the entire U.S. labor force. The world’s wealthiest country is home to numerous communities that have been poor for generations: think parts of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the southern border, and Chicago’s South Side. An Economic Innovation Group report finds that people of color are far more likely to live in “persistently poor” communities – defined as those with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher for at least 30 years – than white Americans. Racial discrimination in many forms, including in education, hiring, and pay practices, contributes to persistent earnings gaps. As of the third quarter of 2023, the median white worker made 24 percent more than the typical Black worker and around 28 percent more than the median Latino worker, according to BLS data . Race and Gender Inequality Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. While student loan burdens have grown significantly for all racial groups, they are particularly heavy for Black students — especially women. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, 43.3 percent of Black women are shouldering student loan debts, compared to just 15.7 percent of white men. Racial inequality in terms of the official poverty rate is also particularly acute for women of color. As National Women’s Law Center research shows, while in 2019 the U.S. poverty rate for white men is 6.0 percent, it is 18 percent for Black women, 15 percent for the Latino community, and 18 percent for Native American women. Racial Inequality and Covid-19 According to APM Research Lab , white and Asian Americans have substantially lower Covid-19 mortality rates than those of other racial and ethnic groups. Between the start of the pandemic and October 2, 2022, indigenous people suffered 582 deaths per 100,000 people – more than twice the death rate for whites and Asians. People of color are more likely to suffer severe illness from Covid-19, regardless of their age. According to CDC data , hospitalization rates have been highest among indigenous and Black Americans. About 2,100 indigenous and 1,700 Black Americans were hospitalized for Covid-related symptoms per 100,000 people in their respective ethnic and race groups between the beginning of the pandemic and October 22, 2022. The racial disparities in Covid-related health indicators have contributed to a steeper decline in the U.S. life expectancy for people of color, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the CDC. Between 2019 and 2021, American Indians and Alaska natives experienced the biggest drop, with life expectancy at birth plunging by more than 6 years to 65.2. The Latino and Black communities both experienced a drop of four years, while Asian and white Americans have seen a decrease of about two years since the start of the pandemic. The pandemic-related economic crisis in 2020 was particularly devastating for people of color. When the shutdown sent unemployment levels skyrocketing in March and April of that year, Black and Latino workers were much more likely to be jobless than white workers, according to BLS data . This remained true despite the fact that people of color made up a disproportionate share of essential workers who had to remain on the job at the start of the pandemic. While the overall unemployment rate has dropped significantly, racial disparities remain. In February 2025, Black unemployment stood at 6.0 percent, compared to 3.8 percent for white workers, according to BLS data . The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the share of U.S. workers who are teleworking for health reasons, but not everyone has the same ability to work from home. According to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Occupational Safety (NIOSH) and Health, Black and Non-white Hispanic workers are less likely to report being able to telework than white and Asian workers. Some 38 percent of Asian workers and 24 percent of white workers reported working from home between May 2020 and July 2021. By contrast, only 19 percent of Black and 14 percent and Non-white Hispanic workers reported working from home in that same time period. The researchers attributed 80 percent of this divide to racial education gaps, since college graduates are more likely to be able to telework. Workers of color with public-facing jobs have been exposed to greater virus risks.'}, {'title': 'The Economic Cost of Racism - IMF F&D', 'url': 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/09/the-economic-cost-of-racism-losavio', 'content': 'Credit: ISTOCK / VLIET; STREETMUSE; SCARLETSAILS; JOSEPH GRUBER; ALEJANDROPHOTOGRAPHY; JOEL CARILLET; JEDRASZAK; JOEL CARILLET; JACOBLUND; 400TMAX'}, {'title': 'Racial and ethnic income inequality in America: 5 key findings', 'url': 'https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/07/12/key-findings-on-the-rise-in-income-inequality-within-americas-racial-and-ethnic-groups/', 'content': 'Income inequality – the gap in incomes between the rich and poor – has increased steadily in the United States since the 1970s. By one measure, the gap between Americans at the top and the bottom of the income ladder increased 27% from 1970 to 2016. However, the rise in inequality within America’s racial and ethnic communities varies strikingly from one group to another, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. In this analysis, which draws on data from the American Community Survey and U.S. decennial censuses, income inequality is measured using the 90/10 ratio – the income of those at the high end (90th percentile) of the income distribution relative to the income of those at the low end (10th percentile). “Income” refers to the resources available to a person based on the income of their household, whether the person had personal earnings or not. Thus, people’s incomes are represented by their household’s income adjusted for household size. (See the report methodology for details.) Here are five key findings from the report: Income inequality in the U.S. is now greatest among Asians. In 2016, the latest year for which data are available, Asians near the top of their income distribution (the 90th percentile) had incomes 10.7 times greater than the incomes of Asians near the bottom of their income distribution (the 10th percentile). The 90/10 ratio among Asians was notably greater than among blacks (9.8), whites (7.8) and Hispanics (7.8). Income inequality among Asians in the U.S. nearly doubled from 1970 to 2016. The top-to-bottom income ratio among Asians increased 77% from 1970 to 2016, a far greater increase than among whites (24%), Hispanics (15%) or blacks (7%). As a result, Asians displaced blacks as the most economically divided racial or ethnic group in the U.S. In 1970, income inequality among Asians was roughly on par with whites and Hispanics and significantly less pronounced than it was among blacks. The Asian experience with inequality reflects the fact that the incomes of Asians near the top increased about nine times faster than the incomes of Asians near the bottom from 1970 to 2016, 96% compared with 11%. These were the greatest and the smallest increases in incomes at the two rungs of the ladder among the racial and ethnic groups analyzed. Asians overall are the highest-earning racial and ethnic group in the U.S., but it is not a status shared by all Asians. In 2016, the median annual income for Asian adults was $51,288, compared with $47,958 for whites, $31,082 for blacks and $30,400 for Hispanics. (The median is the 50th percentile – the middle – of the income distribution.) Asians at the top of their income distribution earned more than others at the top of their distributions, earning 13% more than whites at the 90th percentile and leading Hispanics and blacks by wider margins. Lower-income Asians (at the 10th percentile) earned more than lower-income Hispanics and blacks in 2016, but their earnings fell short of the earnings of lower-income whites by 17%. Income gaps across racial and ethnic groups persist and, in some cases, are wider than in 1970. Large gaps between the incomes of blacks and whites have narrowed only modestly in recent decades. In 2016, blacks at the 90th percentile of their distribution earned 68% as much as whites at their 90th percentile, the same as in 1970. At the median, blacks earned 65% as much as whites in 2016, up from 59% in 1970. Similarly, lower-income blacks narrowed the gap slightly from 47% in 1970 to 54% in 2016. While the income gap between blacks and whites closed somewhat from 1970 to 2016, Hispanics fell even further behind at all income levels. For example, at the high end of the income distribution, Hispanics earned 65% as much as whites in 2016 compared with 74% in 1970. Higher-income Asians moved further out in front of higher-income whites, but lower-income Asians did not keep pace. Asians at the 10th percentile earned 8% more than whites in 1970, but in 2016 they earned 17% less. The Asian and Hispanic experiences with inequality are partly driven by immigration patterns. Immigrants accounted for 81% of the growth in the Asian adult population in our sample from 1970 to 2016. This surge followed the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965, drawing migrants from many countries for family reunification or as refugees , and later through skill-based programs such as the H-1B visa program . The result is a wide variation in education levels and incomes among Asians in the U.S. In 2015, the share with at least a bachelor’s degree among adults ages 25 and older ranged from 9% among Bhutanese to 72% among Indians, median household income varied from $36,000 among Burmese to $100,000 among Indians, and poverty rates were as high as 35% among Burmese and 33% among Bhutanese (incomes not adjusted for household size). Hispanic immigrants, many of whom were unauthorized, accounted for 50% of the growth in the Hispanic adult population in our sample from 1970 to 2016. The Hispanic immigrant population tilts to the lower end of the education and income distributions. In 2015, 47% of foreign-born Hispanics ages 25 and older had not graduated from high school , compared with 13% of Americans overall. And only 11% of Hispanic immigrants had attained at least a bachelor’s degree, compared with 31% of Americans overall. The influx of lower-skill, lower-income immigrants likely exerted a drag on the measured growth in income for Hispanics. Overall, the contrasting experiences of America’s racial and ethnic groups with income inequality – as well as the persistence of gaps in income across them – could reflect differences in the characteristics of workers, such as educational attainment (greater among Asians and whites) and the share foreign born (greater among Asians and Hispanics). In addition, the historical legacy and current impact of discrimination are considered to be an important source of gaps in income across groups.'}]"}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”'}, {'title': 'The psychology of American racism and how to work against it', 'url': 'https://www.apa.org/pubs/highlights/spotlight/issue-189', 'content': ''}]"}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

Understanding the historical context of racism is essential to addressing and dismantling the systems and structures that perpetuate racial inequality.'}, {'sub_q': 'How do social and cultural norms influence racist beliefs and behaviors?', 'answer': 'Social and cultural norms play a significant role in influencing racist beliefs and behaviors. Systemic racism is perpetuated through individual implicit attitudes, socially motivated misperception, and racialized social interactions. These interactions communicate disrespect and distrust, which are rooted in stereotypes and social structure. The associations between race and status, as well as the assumption of meritocracy, contribute to the perpetuation of systemic racism. However, diversity and exposure to different racial groups can help to overcome racial bias and shift systemic racism. Intergroup contact, in particular, has been shown to reduce prejudice and increase understanding. Ultimately, addressing systemic racism requires a comprehensive understanding of its complex and multifaceted nature.'}, {'sub_q': 'What role does economic inequality play in perpetuating racism?', 'answer': "Economic inequality plays a significant role in perpetuating racism, as it creates and maintains wealth gaps between different racial and ethnic groups. Systemic racism has contributed to the persistence of race-based gaps in economic indicators, and public policies that favor white Americans and the wealthy have perpetuated both an extreme concentration of wealth and an extreme racial wealth divide. The racial wealth divide has narrowed slightly since 1989, but remains extremely wide, with the median Black family having a net worth of $44,100, just 15.5 percent of the $282,310 median white wealth. Families of color are more likely to live in 'persistently poor' communities, and racial discrimination in education, hiring, and pay practices contributes to persistent earnings gaps. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the share of U.S. workers who are teleworking for health reasons, but not everyone has the same ability to work from home, with Black and Non-white Hispanic workers being less likely to report being able to telework than white and Asian workers."}, {'sub_q': 'How do psychological factors, such as bias and prejudice, contribute to racism?', 'answer': 'Psychological factors such as bias and prejudice contribute to racism by creating a system of advantage based on race, with categories, factions, segregation, hierarchy, power, media, and passivism all playing a role.

The legacy of these events continues to impact contemporary society, with ongoing issues such as racial disparities in education, employment, healthcare, and the criminal justice system. Understanding the historical context of racism is essential to addressing and dismantling the systems and structures that perpetuate racial inequality."}, {"sub_q": "How do social and cultural norms influence racist beliefs and behaviors?", "answer": "Social and cultural norms play a significant role in influencing racist beliefs and behaviors. Systemic racism is perpetuated through individual implicit attitudes, socially motivated misperception, and racialized social interactions. These interactions communicate disrespect and distrust, which are rooted in stereotypes and social structure. The associations between race and status, as well as the assumption of meritocracy, contribute to the perpetuation of systemic racism. However, diversity and exposure to different racial groups can help to overcome racial bias and shift systemic racism. Intergroup contact, in particular, has been shown to reduce prejudice and increase understanding. Ultimately, addressing systemic racism requires a comprehensive understanding of its complex and multifaceted nature."}, {"sub_q": "What role does economic inequality play in perpetuating racism?", "answer": "Economic inequality plays a significant role in perpetuating racism, as it creates and maintains wealth gaps between different racial and ethnic groups. Systemic racism has contributed to the persistence of race-based gaps in economic indicators, and public policies that favor white Americans and the wealthy have perpetuated both an extreme concentration of wealth and an extreme racial wealth divide. The racial wealth divide has narrowed slightly since 1989, but remains extremely wide, with the median Black family having a net worth of $44,100, just 15.5 percent of the $282,310 median white wealth. Families of color are more likely to live in \'persistently poor\' communities, and racial discrimination in education, hiring, and pay practices contributes to persistent earnings gaps. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the share of U.S. workers who are teleworking for health reasons, but not everyone has the same ability to work from home, with Black and Non-white Hispanic workers being less likely to report being able to telework than white and Asian workers."}, {"sub_q": "How do psychological factors, such as bias and prejudice, contribute to racism?", "answer": "Psychological factors such as bias and prejudice contribute to racism by creating a system of advantage based on race, with categories, factions, segregation, hierarchy, power, media, and passivism all playing a role. These factors can lead to the reinforcement of racism, even among those who do not identify as racist, and can be addressed through awareness, reactive anti-racism, and proactive anti-racism."}]}]', 'agent': 'planner'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': 'required', 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'question_decompose', 'description': 'Decompose one or more complex questions into sub-questions with reasoning.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Why the decomposition is needed'}, 'mapping': {'type': 'array', 'description': 'List of parent questions and their sub-questions', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'parent_q': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The original question being broken down'}, 'sub_questions': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'description': 'List of sub-questions derived from the parent question'}}, 'required': ['parent_q', 'sub_questions'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, 'required': ['reason', 'mapping'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'final_answer', 'description': 'Based on the current information and your confidence, explain why a final answer can be generated.', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Explain why you now have enough information to provide a final answer.'}}, 'required': ['reason'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'strict': True}}]}}

Fredrickson Racism exists when one ethnic group or historical collectivity dominates, excludes, or seeks to eliminate another on the basis of differences that it believes are hereditary and unalterable. An ideological basis for explicit racism came to a unique fruition in the West during the modern period. No clear and unequivocal evidence of racism has been found in other cultures or in Europe before the Middle Ages. The identification of the Jews with the devil and witchcraft in the popular mind of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was perhaps the first sign of a racist view of the world. Official sanction for such attitudes came in sixteenth century Spain when Jews who had converted to Christianity and their descendants became the victims of a pattern of discrimination and exclusion. The period of the Renaissance and Reformation was also the time when Europeans were coming into increasing contact with people of darker pigmentation in Africa, Asia, and the Americas and were making judgments about them. The official rationale for enslaving Africans was that they were heathens, but slave traders and slave owners sometimes interpreted a passage in the book of Genesis as their justification. Ham, they maintained, committed a sin against his father Noah that condemned his supposedly black descendants to be "servants unto servants." When Virginia decreed in 1667 that converted slaves could be kept in bondage, not because they were actual heathens but because they had heathen ancestry, the justification for black servitude was thus changed from religious status to something approaching race. Beginning in the late seventeenth century laws were also passed in English North America forbidding marriage between whites and blacks and discriminating against the mixed offspring of informal liaisons. Without clearly saying so, such laws implied that blacks were unalterably alien and inferior. During the Enlightenment, a secular or scientific theory of race moved the subject away from the Bible, with its insistence on the essential unity of the human race. Eighteenth century ethnologists began to think of human beings as part of the natural world and subdivided them into three to five races, usually considered as varieties of a single human species. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, however, an increasing number of writers, especially those committed to the defense of slavery, maintained that the races constituted separate species.Â The Nineteenth century was an age of emancipation, nationalism, and imperialism--all of which contributed to the growth and intensification of ideological racism in Europe and the United States. Although the emancipation of blacks from slavery and Jews from the ghettos received most of its support from religious or secular believers in an essential human equality, the consequence of these reforms was to intensify rather than diminish racism. Race relations became less paternalistic and more competitive. The insecurities of a burgeoning industrial capitalism created a need for scapegoats. The Darwinian emphasis on "the struggle for existence" and concern for "the survival of the fittest" was conducive to the development of a new and more credible scientific racism in an era that increasingly viewed race relations as an arena for conflict rather than as a stable hierarchy.Â The growth of nationalism, especially romantic cultural nationalism, encouraged the growth of a culture-coded variant of racist thought, especially in Germany. Beginning in the late 1870s and early 1880s, the coiners of the term "antisemitism" made explicit what some cultural nationalists had previously implied--that to be Jewish in Germany was not simply to adhere to a set of religious beliefs or cultural practices but meant belonging to a race that was the antithesis of the race to which true Germans belonged. The climax of Western imperialism in the late nineteenth century "scramble for Africa" and parts of Asia and the Pacific represented an assertion of the competitive ethnic nationalism that existed among European nations (and which, as a result of the Spanish-American War came to include the United States). It also constituted a claim, allegedly based on science, that Europeans had the right to rule over Africans and Asians. The climax of the history of racism came in the twentieth century in the rise and fall of what might be called overtly racist regimes. In the American South, the passage of racial segregation laws and restrictions on black voting rights reduced African Americans to lower caste status. Extreme racist propaganda, which represented black males as ravening beasts lusting after white women, served to rationalize the practice of lynching. A key feature of the racist regime maintained by state law in the South was a fear of sexual contamination through rape or intermarriage, which led to efforts to prevent the conjugal union of whites with those with any known or discernable African ancestry.Â Racist ideology was eventually of course carried to its extreme in Nazi Germany. It took Hitler and his cohorts to attempt the extermination of an entire ethnic group on the basis of a racist ideology. Hitler, it has been said, gave racism a bad name. The moral revulsion of people throughout the world against what the Nazis did, reinforced by scientific studies undermining racist genetics (or eugenics), served to discredit the scientific racism that had been respectable and influential in the United States and Europe before the Second World War.Â Explicit racism also came under devastating attack from the new nations resulting from the decolonization of Africa and Asia and their representatives in the United Nations. The Civil Rights movement in the United States, which succeeded in outlawing legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the 1960s drew crucial support from the growing sense that national interests were threatened when blacks in the United States were mistreated and abused. In the competition with the Soviet Union for "the hearts and minds" of independent Africans and Asians, Jim Crow and the ideology that sustained it became a national embarrassment with possible strategic consequences. The one racist regime that survived the Second World War and the Cold War was the South African in 1948. The laws passed banning all marriage and sexual relations between different "population groups" and requiring separate residential areas for people of mixed race ("Coloreds"), as well as for Africans, signified the same obsession with "race purity" that characterized the other racist regimes. However the climate of world opinion in the wake of the Holocaust induced apologists for apartheid to avoid, for the most part, straightforward biological racism and rest their case for "separate development" mainly on cultural rather than physical differences.Â The defeat of Nazi Germany, the desegregation of the American South in the 1960s, and the establishment of majority rule in South Africa suggest that regimes based on biological racism or its cultural essentialist equivalent are a thing of the past. But racism does not require the full and explicit support of the state and the law. Nor does it require an ideology centered on the concept of biological inequality. Discrimination by institutions and individuals against those perceived as racially different can long persist and even flourish under the illusion of non-racism, as historians of Brazil have recently discovered. The use of allegedly deep-seated cultural differences as a justification for hostility and discrimination against newcomers from the Third World in several European countries has led to allegations of a new "cultural racism." Recent examples of a functionally racist cultural determinism are not in fact unprecedented. They rather represent a reversion to the way that the differences between groups could be made to seem indelible and unbridgeable before the articulation of a scientific or naturalistic conception of race in the eighteenth century.

In its early years, CORE staged a sit-in at a Chicago coffee shop (a precursor to the successful sit-in movement of 1960) and organized a “Journey of Reconciliation,” in which a group of Black and white activists rode together on a bus through the upper South in 1947, a year after the U.S. Supreme Court banned segregation in interstate bus travel. In Boynton v. Virginia (1960), the Court extended the earlier ruling to include bus terminals, restrooms and other related facilities, and CORE took action to test the enforcement of that ruling. In May 1961, CORE sent seven African Americans and six white Americans on a “freedom ride” on two buses from Washington, D.C. Bound for New Orleans , the freedom riders were attacked by angry segregationists outside of Anniston, Alabama, and one bus was even firebombed. Local law enforcement responded, but slowly, and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy eventually ordered State Highway Patrol protection for the freedom riders to continue to Montgomery, Alabama, where they again encountered violent resistance. Kennedy sent federal marshals to escort the riders to Jackson, Mississippi, but images of the bloodshed made the worldwide news, and the freedom rides continued. In September, under pressure from CORE and other civil rights organizations, as well as from the attorney general’s office, the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled that all passengers on interstate bus carriers should be seated without regard to race and carriers could not mandate segregated terminals. Integration of Ole Miss, September 1962 By the end of the 1950s, African Americans had begun to be admitted in small numbers to white colleges and universities in the South without too much incident. In 1962, however, a crisis erupted when the state-funded University of Mississippi (known as “Ole Miss”) admitted a Black man , James Meredith. After nine years in the Air Force, Meredith had studied at the all–Black Jackson State College and applied repeatedly to Ole Miss with no success. With the aid of the NAACP, Meredith filed a lawsuit alleging that the university had discriminated against him because of his race. In September 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Meredith’s favor, but state officials including Governor Ross Barnett vowed to block his admission. When Meredith arrived at Ole Miss under the protection of federal forces including U.S. marshals, a mob of more than 2,000 people formed on the Oxford, Mississippi campus. Two people were killed and close to 200 injured in the ensuing chaos, which ended only after President Kennedy’s administration sent some 31,000 troops to restore order. Meredith went on to graduate from Ole Miss in 1963, but the struggle to integrate higher education continued. Later that year, Governor George Wallace blocked the enrollment of a Black student at the University of Alabama, pledging to “stand in the schoolhouse door.” Though Wallace was eventually forced by the federalized National Guard to integrate the university, he became a prominent symbol of the ongoing resistance to desegregation nearly a decade after Brown v. Board of Education. Birmingham Church Bombed, 1963 Despite Martin Luther King Jr.’s inspiring words at the Lincoln Memorial during the historic March on Washington in August 1963, violence against Black people in the segregated South continued to indicate the strength of white resistance to the ideals of justice and racial harmony King espoused. In mid-September, white supremacists bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama during Sunday services; four young African American girls were killed in the explosion. The church bombing was the third in 11 days after the federal government had ordered the integration of Alabama’s school system. Governor George Wallace was a leading foe of desegregation, and Birmingham had one of the strongest and most violent chapters of the Ku Klux Klan. Birmingham had become a leading focus of the civil rights movement by the spring of 1963 when Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested there while leading supporters of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in a nonviolent campaign of demonstrations against segregation. While in jail, King wrote a letter to local white ministers justifying his decision not to call off the demonstrations in the face of continued bloodshed at the hands of local law enforcement officials, led by Birmingham’s police commissioner, Eugene “Bull” Connor. “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” was published in the national press even as images of police brutality against protesters in Birmingham–including children being attacked by police dogs and knocked off their feet by fire hoses–sent shock waves around the world, helping to build crucial support for the civil rights movement. \'I Have a Dream,\' 1963 On August 28, 1963, some 250,000 people—both Black and white—participated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the largest demonstration in the history of the nation’s capital and the most significant display of the civil rights movement’s growing strength. After marching from the Washington Monument, the demonstrators gathered near the Lincoln Memorial, where a number of civil rights leaders addressed the crowd, calling for voting rights, equal employment opportunities for Black Americans and an end to racial segregation. The last leader to appear was the Baptist preacher Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), who spoke eloquently of the struggle facing Black Americans and the need for continued action and nonviolent resistance. “ I have a dream ,” King intoned, expressing his faith that one day white and Black people would stand together as equals, and there would be harmony between the races: “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” King’s improvised sermon continued for nine minutes after the end of his prepared remarks, and his stirring words would be remembered as undoubtedly one of the greatest speeches in American history. At its conclusion, King quoted an “old Negro spiritual: ‘Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\'” King’s speech served as a defining moment for the civil rights movement, and he soon emerged as its most prominent figure. Civil Rights Act of 1964, July 1964 Thanks to the campaign of nonviolent resistance championed by Martin Luther King Jr. beginning in the late 1950s, the civil rights movement had begun to gain serious momentum in the United States by 1960. That year, John F. Kennedy made passage of new civil rights legislation part of his presidential campaign platform; he won more than 70 percent of the African American vote. Congress was debating Kennedy’s civil rights reform bill when he was killed by an assassin’s bullet in Dallas, Texas in November 1963. It was left to Lyndon Johnson (not previously known for his support of civil rights) to push the Civil Rights Act —the most far-reaching act of legislation supporting racial equality in American history—through Congress in June 1964. At its most basic level, the act gave the federal government more power to protect citizens against discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin. It mandated the desegregation of most public accommodations, including lunch counters, bus depots, parks and swimming pools, and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to ensure equal treatment of minorities in the workplace. The act also guaranteed equal voting rights by removing biased registration requirements and procedures and authorized the U.S. Office of Education to provide aid to assist with school desegregation. In a televised ceremony on July 2, 1964, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law using 75 pens; he presented one of them to King, who counted it among his most prized possessions. Freedom Summer and the \'Mississippi Burning\' Murders, June 1964 In the summer of 1964, civil rights organizations including the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) urged white students from the North to travel to Mississippi, where they helped register Black voters and build schools for Black children. The organizations believed the participation of white students in the so-called “Freedom Summer” would bring increased visibility to their efforts. The summer had barely begun, however, when three volunteers—Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both white New Yorkers, and James Chaney, a Black Mississippian—disappeared on their way back from investigating the burning of an African American church by the Ku Klux Klan. After a massive FBI investigation (code–named “Mississippi Burning”) their bodies were discovered on August 4 buried in an earthen dam near Philadelphia, in Neshoba County, Mississippi. Although the culprits in the case—white supremacists who included the county’s deputy sheriff—were soon identified, the state made no arrests. The Justice Department eventually indicted 19 men for violating the three volunteers’ civil rights (the only charge that would give the federal government jurisdiction over the case) and after a three-year-long legal battle, the men finally went on trial in Jackson, Mississippi. In October 1967, an all-white jury found seven of the defendants guilty and acquitted the other nine. Though the verdict was hailed as a major civil rights victory—it was the first time anyone in Mississippi had been convicted for a crime against a civil rights worker—the judge in the case gave out relatively light sentences, and none of the convicted men served more than six years behind bars.

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”\'}]'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

For educators, leading conversations about race and racism is a challenging, but necessary, part of their work. “Schools operate within larger contexts: systems of race, racism, and white supremacy; systems of migration and ethnic identity formation; patterns of socialization; the changing realities of capitalism and politics,” explains historian and Harvard lecturer Timothy Patrick McCarthy , co-faculty lead of Race and Ethnicity in Context, a new module offered at the Harvard Graduate School of Education this January as part of a pilot of HGSE’s Equity and Opportunity Foundations course. “How do we understand the role that racial and ethnic identity play with respect to equity and opportunity within an educational context?” >> Learn more about Equity and Opportunity and HGSE’s other foundational learning experiences. For educators exploring question in their own homes, schools, and communities, McCarthy and co-faculty lead Ashley Ison, an HGSE doctoral student, offer five ways to get started. 1. Begin with the self. Practitioners enter conversations about race and racism from different backgrounds, with different lived experiences, personal and professional perspectives, and funds of knowledge in their grasps. Given diverse contexts and realities, it is important that leaders encourage personal transformation and growth. Educators should consider how race and racism, as well as racial and ethnic identity formation, impact their lives as educational professionals, as parents, and as policymakers – whatever roles they hold in society. “This is personal work, but that personal work is also political work,” says Ison. 2. Model vulnerability. Entering into discussions of race and racism can be challenging, even for those with experience in this work. A key part of enabling participants to lean into the challenge is being vulnerable. “You have trust your students,” explains McCarthy. “Part of that is modeling authentic vulnerability and proximity to the work.” This can be done by modeling discussion skills, like sharing the space and engaging directly with the comments of other participants, as well as by opening up personally to participants. “Fear can impact how people feel talking about race and ethnicity in an inter-group space,” says Ison. Courage, openness, and trust are key to overcoming that fear and enabling listening, which ultimately allows for critical thinking and change. 3. Be transparent. Part of being vulnerable is being fully transparent with your students from day one. “Intentions are important,” explains McCarthy. “The gap between intention and impact is often rooted in a lack of transparency about where you’re coming from or where you are hoping to go.” 4. Center voices of color. Voice and story are powerful tools in this work. Leaders must consider whose voices and stories take precedence on the syllabus. “Consider highlighting authors of color, in particular, who are thinking and writing about these issues,” says Ison. Becoming familiar with a variety of perspectives can help practitioners understand the voices and ideas that exist, she explains. “Voice and storytelling can bear witness to the various kinds of systematic injustices and inequities we are looking at, but they also function as sources of power for imagining and reimagining the world we are trying to build, all while providing a deeper knowledge of the world as it has existed historically,” adds McCarthy. 5. Prioritize discussion and reflection. Since this work is as much about critical thinking as it is about content, it is important for educators to make space for discussion and reflection, at the whole-class, small-group, and individual levels. Ison and McCarthy encourage educators to allow students to generate and guide the discussion of predetermined course materials. They also recommend facilitating small group reflections that may spark conversation that can extend into other spaces outside of the classroom.\'}, {\'title\': \'Race As A Social Construct: Comprehensive Guide To Its Origins ...\', \'url\': \'https://csce310h-video.unl.edu/race-as-a-social-construct-comprehensive-guide-to-its-origins-and-effects\', \'content\': \'Race As A Social Construct: Comprehensive Guide To Its Origins & Effects The concept of race, often perceived as a biological reality, is fundamentally a social construct. This idea, shaped by historical, cultural, and political forces, has had profound and lasting effects on societies worldwide. From its origins in colonial ideologies to its modern manifestations in systemic inequalities, understanding race as a social construct is essential for addressing the persistent disparities it has created. The Origins of Race as a Social Construct Colonialism and the Birth of Racial Categorization The modern concept of race emerged during the Age of Exploration and the subsequent colonial era. As European powers expanded their empires, they encountered diverse populations and needed a framework to justify their domination. The 16th and 17th centuries saw the development of racial hierarchies, with Europeans positioned at the top and indigenous peoples, Africans, and Asians relegated to inferior statuses. This categorization was not based on biological differences but on economic and political expediency. "Race was invented to justify the exploitation of one group by another," notes historian Ibram X. Kendi, highlighting the constructed nature of racial identities. Scientific Racism and Its Legacy In the 18th and 19th centuries, the idea of race was further solidified through "scientific racism." Scholars like Carl Linnaeus and Samuel George Morton attempted to classify humans into distinct racial groups based on physical traits, such as skin color and skull measurements. These efforts were deeply flawed, yet they lent a veneer of scientific credibility to racial hierarchies. The legacy of scientific racism persists in contemporary discussions about race and genetics, despite overwhelming evidence that genetic variation within racial groups is greater than between them. The Role of Race in Slavery and Colonialism Race became a central tool in the institution of slavery, particularly in the Americas. The transatlantic slave trade, which forcibly displaced over 12 million Africans, was justified through racial ideology. Enslaved Africans were dehumanized and portrayed as inferior to reinforce their exploitation. Similarly, colonialism in Asia, Africa, and the Americas relied on racial hierarchies to subjugate indigenous populations and extract resources. Economic Exploitation: Racial categorization enabled the systematic exploitation of labor and resources. Cultural Erasure: Colonizers often suppressed indigenous languages, religions, and customs, imposing their own as superior. Case Study: The One-Drop Rule in the United States In the U.S., the "one-drop rule," which classified individuals with any African ancestry as Black, exemplifies how race was constructed to maintain racial hierarchies. This rule, codified in law in many states, served to preserve the purity of the White race and reinforce the subjugation of Black people. It also highlights the arbitrary nature of racial classifications, as they were often based on social and political needs rather than biological reality. The Effects of Racial Constructs on Society Systemic Inequalities and Racial Disparities The social construction of race has led to systemic inequalities that persist to this day. In the U.S., for example, racial disparities are evident in areas such as: Area Disparity Wealth The median wealth of White households is nearly ten times that of Black households. Education Black and Latino students are more likely to attend underfunded schools. Healthcare Racial minorities experience higher rates of chronic illnesses and lower life expectancies. Criminal Justice Black individuals are incarcerated at five times the rate of White individuals. Psychological and Social Impacts Race also affects individuals on a psychological level. Racial stereotypes and prejudice contribute to internalized racism, where members of marginalized groups may adopt negative beliefs about their own worth. Additionally, racial discrimination can lead to chronic stress, mental health issues, and reduced life satisfaction. On a societal level, racial constructs perpetuate division and hinder collective progress. Challenging Racial Constructs The Role of Education and Advocacy Challenging the social construction of race requires education and advocacy. Teaching the history of race as a construct can help dismantle misconceptions and promote empathy. Movements like Black Lives Matter and indigenous rights campaigns have also played a crucial role in challenging racial hierarchies and advocating for equality. Policy Reforms: Implementing policies that address systemic inequalities, such as affordable housing and healthcare. Cultural Representation: Promoting diverse representation in media, arts, and leadership positions. Intergroup Dialogue: Facilitating conversations across racial lines to build understanding and solidarity. Imagining a Post-Racial Society What would society look like if race were no longer a defining factor? This thought experiment encourages us to envision a world where individuals are judged on their merits rather than their racial background. While a post-racial society may seem idealistic, it serves as a powerful reminder of the need to challenge and ultimately dismantle the racial constructs that divide us. Is race biologically determined? + No, race is not biologically determined. While there are genetic variations among humans, these differences do not align with racial categories. Race is a social construct based on cultural, historical, and political factors. How does race intersect with other forms of identity? + Race intersects with other identities such as gender, class, and sexuality, creating unique experiences of privilege and oppression. For example, Black women may face both racism and sexism, a phenomenon known as intersectionality. Can racial constructs be unlearned? + Yes, through education, exposure to diverse perspectives, and conscious effort, individuals can unlearn racial biases and challenge the constructs that perpetuate inequality. What role does language play in perpetuating racial constructs? + Language plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of race. The use of racial slurs, stereotypes, and biased terminology reinforces racial hierarchies and can perpetuate harm. How can individuals contribute to racial justice? + Individuals can contribute to racial justice by educating themselves, supporting policies that address systemic inequalities, and engaging in anti-racist actions in their communities. Conclusion: Toward a More Equitable Future Race, as a social construct, has shaped the course of history and continues to influence contemporary society. By understanding its origins and effects, we can work toward dismantling the systemic inequalities it has created. This requires a collective effort to challenge racial constructs, promote education, and advocate for policies that foster equity and justice. Only then can we move toward a future where race no longer serves as a barrier to human potential and dignity. This comprehensive guide underscores the importance of recognizing race as a social construct, not a biological reality. By doing so, we can address the root causes of racial disparities and strive for a more just and inclusive world.\'}]'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

The history of education in the United States is rife with instances of violence and oppression along lines of race and ethnicity. To address these issues, educators must begin with self-reflection, model vulnerability, be transparent, center voices of color, and prioritize discussion and reflection. The concept of race is a social construct, shaped by historical, cultural, and political forces, and has had profound and lasting effects on societies worldwide. Understanding race as a social construct is essential for addressing the persistent disparities it has created.

Refers to the unquestioned and unearned set of advantages, entitlements, benefits and choices bestowed on people solely because they are white. Generally white people who experience such privilege do so without being conscious of it. 2. Structural White Privilege : A system of white domination that creates and maintains belief systems that make current racial advantages and disadvantages seem normal. The system includes powerful incentives for maintaining white privilege and its consequences, and powerful negative consequences for trying to interrupt white privilege or reduce its consequences in meaningful ways. The system includes internal and external manifestations at the individual, interpersonal, cultural and institutional levels. The accumulated and interrelated advantages and disadvantages of white privilege that are reflected in racial/ethnic inequities in life-expectancy and other health outcomes, income and wealth, and other outcomes, in part through different access to opportunities and resources. These differences are maintained in part by denying that these advantages and disadvantages exist at the structural, institutional, cultural, interpersonal, and individual levels and by refusing to redress them or eliminate the systems, policies, practices, cultural norms, and other behaviors and assumptions that maintain them. Interpersonal White Privilege : Behavior between people that consciously or unconsciously reflects white superiority or entitlement. Cultural White Privilege : A set of dominant cultural assumptions about what is good, normal or appropriate that reflects Western European white world views and dismisses or demonizes other world views. Institutional White Privilege : Policies, practices and behaviors of institutions—such as schools, banks, non-profits or the Supreme Court—that have the effect of maintaining or increasing accumulated advantages for those groups currently defined as white, and maintaining or increasing disadvantages for those racial or ethnic groups not defined as white. The ability of institutions to survive and thrive even when their policies, practices and behaviors maintain, expand or fail to redress accumulated disadvantages and/or inequitable outcomes for people of color.

And then, in May, video footage of the horrific murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police ignited a blaze of protest that spread across the United States and also Canada, a country with its own history of colonialism and racism. The depth of the reflection and conversation – public and private – provoked by the protests was unprecedented. For the first time, many of this country’s leaders unequivocally acknowledged the existence of systemic racism in Canada, and reflected the predominant public sentiment. Our own research shows that a significant majority of Canadians now recognize the reality of racial discrimination in this country, especially as it affects people who are Indigenous and Black. Such recognition of racism in our society is a significant milestone, long in coming. Doing something about it becomes the next step, and represents an even greater challenge given how deeply such prejudice is embedded in Canada’s dominant culture and institutions. Evidence of its pervasiveness confronts us both in personal anecdotes and in hard data on racial disparities across many areas of society – from policing and health to education and social welfare. It is commonly believed that the biggest obstacle to meaningful change is our inability to recognize our own racial prejudices. The prevalence of unconscious racism or “implicit bias” has been well documented by American social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt (in her seminal book, Biased) and others. Some have responded by taking steps to make the implicit explicit through education generally, and diversity and anti-racism training in particular. Governments and corporations have invested in programs to teach employees about bias and stereotypes, hoping that raising consciousness will change attitudes, assumptions, and behaviour. But the evidence is emerging that this strategy is not effective in producing lasting change, as recently reported in a meta-analysis of close to 1,000 studies of anti-bias interventions. Efforts to reduce bias through education and training may simply not work because it is impossible to change people’s ingrained mindsets and emotions, at least in the short term. A more promising avenue to consider is the social context in which people operate when they interact with others. Implicit in diversity training is the idea that racism is fuelled mainly by what people know and think, but what matters more is what people say and how they behave in the presence of others. Outward expressions of racism are governed in large part by collective social norms about acceptable behaviour. The term “norms” sometimes gets mentioned in the context of problematic content on social media, but what has yet to receive any serious attention is the concept of “social norms” as a fundamental aspect of society that contributes to the systemic nature of racism and where we might focus to address the problem. Social norms are widely held expectations about what is, and is not, acceptable to say and do in particular situations. What is distinctive about such norms is that they are not defined by what people think is important to them personally, but by what they see as the social expectations of others whose opinions matter to them. As such, norms exert a powerful influence on how people act in public and social situations, quite apart from what they may think or feel inside. These norms are typically well entrenched but do change over time. The Holocaust led many people to decide it was no longer acceptable to articulate anti-Jewish stereotypes. The growing awareness of LGBTQ individuals in society and the legislative endorsement of same-sex marriage both improved attitudes and also made it no longer socially acceptable to trade in homophobic slurs. Many people may still harbour negative views about Jews and LGBTQ people, but most now understand it is no longer okay to express them. Sometimes social norms change as a result of intentional efforts. Arguably the most striking example is the successful campaign to change norms around tobacco use in public. Just over a generation ago, smoking in public was common, even cool. Today, the behaviour has become effectively “denormalized” as inconsiderate and self-defeating, even as a significant proportion of the population continues to smoke in private. Regulatory measures that restrict smoking in public settings are also important, but it is the norms more than the laws that govern behaviour. By contrast, consider jaywalking, which is also legally forbidden but widely socially accepted. Social norms play a key role in the dynamics of racism and prejudice because they establish the boundaries around which people act toward those they see as “other.” While internal attitudes and stereotypes are stubbornly resistant to short-term change, action and speech are more amenable to influence and normative pressures. This means that focusing on social norms can be an effective strategy for addressing racism in a meaningful way – especially if the collective norms against intolerance and discrimination are strengthening, which now appears to be happening. Evidence for this can be found in the recent public condemnation of wearing “blackface” in costume, which in a different era was considered by many to be harmless party attire. There is nothing new about the concept of social norms, which social scientists have studied in academic settings and applied to public health challenges in developing countries. What has been missing is the practical application of this science to important societal problems like racism, as well as other pressing challenges such as promoting physical distancing during a pandemic. The essential starting point is to first properly define and measure specific social norms about race-related actions and speech in order to determine their breadth and strength across the population ( a type of research our Institute now plans to undertake ). Such information can then point to where interventions might be directed – to reinforce “positive norms” that are currently prevalent in society (no wearing of blackface) and de-normalizing “negative norms” (e.g., telling jokes that demean the “other”). This might take the form of public awareness campaigns (as was done to de-normalize public smoking) or employee-directed programs. Government and corporate leaders might be effective communicators of appropriate normative behaviour, to the extent they are credible and can exert influence over relevant audiences (which research might confirm). Today in Canada, our understanding of the current reality of racial injustice is at odds with our stated aspirations of justice and inclusion. This tension provides us with a valuable opportunity to create a more just society by developing new strategies that effectively apply normative pressures on each other to do a better job of treating each other as we ourselves expect to be treated.

Let\'s read up and then try out a practice question on the topic. Culture, race, and ethnicity significantly influence behaviors, attitudes, and identity, shaping how individuals perceive themselves and interact with the world. These factors can contribute to a person’s values, communication styles, coping mechanisms, and sense of belonging. Here\'s a basic rundown of essential concepts for the exam: Culture and Its Impact Culture refers to shared beliefs, practices, norms, and values of a group. It shapes behavior, attitudes, and identity by providing a framework for understanding the world. Behaviors Can determine communication styles (direct vs. indirect, verbal vs. nonverbal). Influences decision-making, conflict resolution, and family roles. Can shape expressions of emotions and acceptable behaviors in different settings. Attitudes Defines beliefs about authority, gender roles, and education. Impacts views on health, mental illness, and treatment-seeking behaviors. Shapes attitudes towards individualism vs. collectivism. Identity Cultural identity involves shared language, traditions, and practices. Provides a sense of belonging and pride. Influences self-concept and how individuals define themselves within a group. Race and Its Impact Race is often defined by physical characteristics and is a socially constructed concept that impacts individuals\' experiences and societal attitudes. Behaviors Experiences of discrimination and racism can lead to hypervigilance, distrust, or resistance behaviors. Coping strategies may include withdrawal, activism, or resilience-building practices. Attitudes Impacts perceptions of fairness, justice, and authority. Can influence self-esteem positively (racial pride) or negatively (internalized racism). Identity Racial identity development involves stages, from unawareness to integration. Intersectionality: how race intersects with gender, class, and other identities to shape experiences. Ethnicity and Its Impact Ethnicity refers to shared cultural traits, such as language, history, and religious practices. Potential Behaviors May prescribe dietary practices, dress codes, and religious observances. Can shape family dynamics and intergenerational behaviors. Attitudes Influences perceptions of in-group (us) vs. out-group (them). Can shape attitudes toward other ethnic groups, potentially leading to ethnocentrism. Identity Ethnic identity includes a sense of shared history and cultural pride. Can act as a protective factor against stress and discrimination. Intersections and Challenges Intersectionality: Understanding how culture, race, and ethnicity intersect with gender, class, and other identities to impact experiences and oppression. Acculturation and Assimilation: Balancing cultural retention with adaptation in new environments. Stereotype Threat: Fear of confirming stereotypes can affect behavior and performance. Internalized Oppression: Adoption of negative beliefs about one\'s own group, impacting self-esteem and identity. Implications for Social Work Practice Cultural Competence: Understanding and respecting diverse cultural perspectives. Culturally Responsive Interventions: Adapting approaches to align with cultural beliefs and practices. Advocacy: Addressing systemic racism and promoting equity. On the Exam An ASWB exam question based on this material might look something like this: During a session, a client who identifies as African American expresses feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy, attributing them to past experiences of discrimination. The social worker recognizes these feelings as potential indicators of: A. Stereotype threat B. Cultural assimilation C. Internalized oppression D. Racial microaggressions Have your answer? Internalized oppression occurs when individuals adopt negative beliefs about their own group due to societal discrimination, leading to self-doubt and decreased self-esteem. The correct answer is C. Why not A? Stereotype threat involves fear of confirming stereotypes in performance situations, which is related but not the same. Why not B? Cultural assimilation refers to adopting the dominant culture’s practices, not self-doubt caused by discrimination. Why not D? Racial microaggressions are common, often subtle, race-based discriminatory actions, not the internalization of these messages.

Roberts , a Stanford psychologist, that arrives during a time of heightened attention to racial injustice in the United States. Steven O. Roberts (Image credit: L.A. Cicero) In the paper, which is available online and will appear in an upcoming issue of American Psychologist , the journal of the American Psychological Association, the scholars contend that racism is a deeply American problem and identify, based on a review of prior research published on the topic, seven factors contributing to racism in the U.S. today. “People often define racism as disliking or mistreating others on the basis of race. That definition is wrong,” said Roberts, who directs the Social Concepts Lab, part of the psychology department, in the School of Humanities and Sciences . “Racism is a system of advantage based on race. It is a hierarchy. It is a pandemic. Racism is so deeply embedded within U.S. minds and U.S. society that it is virtually impossible to escape.” Roberts, an assistant professor and co-author, Michael Rizzo, a postdoctoral fellow at New York University and the Beyond Conflict Innovation Lab, write that “just as citizens of capitalistic societies reinforce capitalism, whether they identify as capitalist or not, and whether they want to or not, citizens of racist societies reinforce racism, whether they identify as racist or not, and whether they want to or not.” After examining research on racism from psychology, the social sciences and the humanities, the researchers argue that American racism systematically advantages White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color – but that it does not have to. It all starts with awareness, they contend. “Many people, especially White people, underestimate the depths of racism,” Rizzo said. “A lot of attention is rightfully put on the recent murders of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and far too many others. But people need to understand that those horrific events are a consequence of a larger system. We want readers to walk away with a better understanding of how that system works.” Seven factors The first three factors Roberts and Rizzo reviewed are: categories , which organize people into distinct groups; factions , which trigger ingroup loyalty and intergroup competition; and segregation , which hardens racist perceptions, preferences and beliefs. Simply put, the U.S. systematically constructs racial categories, places people inside of those categories and segregates people on the basis of those categories, the authors argue. For example, there is a considerable body of research showing that people, adults and children alike, tend to feel and act more positively toward those they consider to be like them and in their “ingroup.” This means that they are likely to treat people from outside of their social circles less favorably. For many White Americans, their ingroups do not include Black Americans. Part of the reason for this has to do with America’s fraught history of racial segregation, which kept White and Black communities separated. Roberts and Rizzo point to studies demonstrating that the amount of exposure a child has to other racial groups early in life affects how they will think about and act toward those groups when they are adults. Research also shows that children are more attuned to faces of the racial majority group. That is, Black children are better at recognizing White faces than White children are at recognizing Black faces. This disparity can have tragic real-world consequences. In a criminal lineup, for instance, not being able to recognize Black faces, paired with biased preferences and beliefs, increase the odds that an innocent Black suspect will be misidentified as the perpetrator of a crime. Roberts and Rizzo note that in cases where felony convictions were overturned because of DNA evidence, a significant number of the original convictions were due to incorrect eyewitness identifications. The remaining four factors the researchers argue contribute to American racism include: hierarchy , which emboldens people to think, feel and behave in racist ways; power , which legislates racism on both micro and macro levels; media , which legitimizes overrepresented and idealized representations of White Americans while marginalizing and minimizing people of color; and passivism , such that overlooking or denying the existence of racism encourages others to do the same. In short, they argue that the U.S. positions and empowers some over others, reinforces those differences through biased media, and then leaves those disparities and media in place. Of the seven factors they identified, perhaps the most insidious is passivism or passive racism, according to the scholars. This includes an apathy toward systems of racial advantage or denial that those systems even exist. Discussions about passivism are particularly relevant now, Roberts said, as thousands take to the streets to protest against racism. “If people advantaged by the hierarchy remain passive, it is no surprise that those at the bottom cry out to be heard,” he added. “People have been crying for centuries.” Anti-racism At the end of the review, the scholars call for a move to anti-racism. Inspired by historian Ibram X. Kendi’s work, Roberts and Rizzo contribute two new terms to the conversation – reactive anti-racism, defined as challenging racism whenever it appears, and proactive anti-racism, or challenging racism before it appears. “One of the most important steps for future research will be to shift our attention away from how people become racist, and toward the contextual influences, psychological processes and developmental mechanisms that help people become anti-racist,” Roberts and Rizzo wrote. “In a state of increasing racial inequality, we hope to find future students and scholars, both in the U.S. and beyond, well-versed and embedded within a psychology of anti-racism.” In a move that they hope becomes standard, the scholars included an author’s statement in their paper indicating that one author, Roberts, identifies as Black American and the other, Rizzo, as White American. “We [psychologists] often present ourselves as objective observers, but I think it’s important to acknowledge our own positionality,” Roberts said. “We put it in the author’s note to normalize it and say good work can come when people from different identities work together for a common goal.”'}, {'title': 'The psychology of American racism and how to work against it', 'url': 'https://www.apa.org/pubs/highlights/spotlight/issue-189', 'content': ''}]"}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

But their social, economic and political advances in the 60 years since the enactment of major civil rights legislation have been unsatisfactory, according to a new annual study on racial progress. The “ State of Black America ” report by the National Urban League, which has compiled research and analysis on the status of Black Americans in the U.S. for decades, cites legal challenges to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and backlash to efforts meant to advance racial progress such as affirmative action and diversity, equity and inclusion policies for decelerating progress. “Doors have been opened in higher education, government and the private sector in that sixty year period. That’s important. Every measure shows progress,” National Urban League President Marc Morial said, in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the report’s release Friday. READ MORE: Schools say dress codes promote discipline, but many Black students see traces of racism “But I would have thought we would have been much further along than we are in 2024 with respect to achieving a sense of parity in America,” Morial said. Despite significant economic advancement over several decades, the report also highlights numerous barriers to economic advancement. The result, the report’s authors write, is persistent economic and political disparities. The racial income gap has been virtually unchanged for more than 20 years, with Black Americans making on average 64 percent of the income of white people, the report notes. Similarly, the study highlighted barriers in opportunity. For instance, Black students are still more likely than their white counterparts to have uncertified and inexperienced teachers. At the same time, the number of Black students dropping out of primary education has decreased from 13.1 percent in 2000 to 3.9 percent in 2024. The view of Black civic participation is also mixed. While the percentage of Black Americans registered to vote stood at 69 percent in 2020 compared to 64 percent in 2000, the percentage of Black people who voted in 2022 stood at 42.3 percent, a drop from 54 percent who cast ballots in 2002. At the current pace, it would take anywhere from one to three centuries for most Black Americans to achieve parity with their white peers, depending on their region of the country, according to a February study by the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility.

We see it being played out right now, ” Morial said in reference to issues such as political gerrymandering, book-banning in schools and attacks on diversity policies. Morial pointed to the current U.S. Supreme Court, which he said “has demonstrated a hostility to the tools necessary to correct the long history of racial discrimination.’ The Urban League’s study also evaluates President Joe Biden’s performance in office and finds his administration’s efforts fall short of promises made to Black Americans, even as the president faces significant opposition from Republican lawmakers and some in his own party. The report, however, broadly approves of Biden’s policy agenda. A record-low Black unemployment rate, as well as efforts to expand health-care access and affordable housing for Black Americans are signs of progress, the authors wrote.

Kristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department, said federal watchdogs are ready to ensure the nation’s civil rights laws are being followed. “We’ve been working across the country to reach underserved communities so that we understand the problems that communities face,” Clarke said in an interview with the AP. “Our country thrives when everyone has a voice in our democracy and we remain vigilant and work to counter voting discrimination and voter suppression wherever it rears its ugly head.” On the eve of the Bloody Sunday anniversary events commemorating voting rights marches in Selma, Alabama this weekend, Morial called on federal officials to increase their efforts to protect civil rights and to better support sociopolitical advances in the Black community. “This moment is a reminder about our obligation to confront voter suppression and continuing threats that we see when it comes to access to the ballot box,” he said.

Economic disparities in the U.S. among racial demographic groups are large. In 2019, median net worth was $188,000 for White families, $24,100 for Black families, and $36,100 for Hispanic families. 1 Those of Asian descent had somewhat lower median wealth than White families but significantly higher median wealth than Black and Hispanic families. Such economic disparities directly affect the well-being of individuals in the affected racial groups as well as society at large. When economic statistics are disaggregated by racial group, social scientists can learn more about these disparities. In her paper, “ Economic Activity by Race ,” Fatima Mboup of the Philadelphia Fed describes how she developed an index of economic activity across four U.S. demographic groups. This comprehensive index, which she calls Economic Activity by Race, or EAR, can help policymakers support economic well-being across racial groups. “We lack a timely, more encompassing measure of economic activity, such as national GDP [gross domestic product], for demographic groups,” she notes, but EAR fills that gap by providing a current pulse on economic activity in the U.S. by race. EAR is especially useful during recessions, she points out, because Black and Hispanic workers are disproportionately hard hit during an economic downturn, and they benefit less from the subsequent recovery. 2 Although some surveys and data measure components of economic well-being by race, they are not “well-rounded timely measure[s] of economic activity for any given demographic group,” Mboup explains. Fortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the U.S. Census Bureau produce several economic indicators that help us measure national economic activity by race. To create EAR, Mboup used nine of these macroeconomic indicators across the Hispanic, Asian, Black, and White populations in the U.S. for the 1980–2022 period. These indicators are average hours worked weekly, number of people employed, the unemployment rate, median weekly wages, assets, percent of the population in poverty, median annual income, net worth, and consumer expenditures. 3 Because many of these macroeconomic indicators move together over the business cycle (that is, the data are “noisy”), she developed the index using an econometric technique known as the Kalman filter, which allowed her to extract the relevant component within all the data series. Although she uses a mix of monthly, quarterly, annual, and triennial data, she has been able to update her index monthly. 4 When compared to real GDP, EAR in the aggregate (across all races) “is a good proxy for U.S. economic health,” Mboup writes, and thus she expects EAR for each individual race to be a good proxy for the economic conditions of that racial category. She finds that economic activity for each race fluctuated similarly across the business cycle over her sample period, but the index itself shows differences by race. Indeed, she finds sizable disparities in economic activity among racial groups, including both during and after recessions. Notably, she finds large differences in EAR for the White and Black populations, which is consistent with the findings from the literature on racial stratification. 5 For example, according to the existing literature, the Black unemployment rate has generally been about twice the White unemployment rate, even when the labor market has been strong. Such disparities in income and wealth, she stresses, in turn limit access to consumption and investment by disadvantaged demographic groups. Mboup also finds that an economic shock has a longer-lasting effect on White economic activity than it does on Black, Asian, or Hispanic economic activity. She attributes this to the larger role that assets play in White income and economic activity. These assets are more sensitive to shocks, explaining why a negative shock impacts White households’ net worth for longer, but those same assets provide a cushion during these negative shocks. What’s more, assets gain value during a business cycle upswing, outpacing even income growth, further benefiting White households more than others. By measuring EAR, Mboup argues, “we can get a timelier sense of what kind of policies need to be put in place to eliminate racial economic disparities.” If the EAR for all races decreases, for example, that could signal the need for a more aggressive monetary policy. However, if the EAR is doing relatively well for some races while less so for others, that could signal the need for a fiscal policy designed to shrink the economic disparities between races.\'}, {\'title\': \'Racial Economic Inequality\', \'url\': \'https://inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/\', \'content\': \'Systemic racism has contributed to the persistence of race-based gaps that manifest in many different economic indicators. The starkest divides are in measures of household wealth, reflecting centuries of white privilege that have made it particularly difficult for people of color to achieve economic security. This series of charts begins with a look at how the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequalities. Racial Wealth Divide By the middle of the 21st century, the United States will be a “majority minority” nation. If we hope to ensure a strong middle class, historically the backbone of the national economy, then improving the financial health of households of color will become even more urgent than it is today. Closing the persistent “wealth divide” between white households and households of color, already a matter of social justice, must become a priority for broader economic policy. Public policies that favor white Americans and the wealthy have perpetuated both an extreme concentration of wealth and an extreme racial wealth divide. White households, Federal Reserve data show, held 84.2 percent of all U.S. wealth as of the fourth quarter of 2023, while making up only 66 percent of households. By contrast, Black families accounted for 11.4 percent of households and owned 3.4 percent of total family wealth, while Hispanic families represented 9.6 percent of households and owned 2.3 percent of total family wealth. These wealth figures include the value of consumer durable goods, such as vehicles. The racial wealth divide, according to Survey of Consumer Finances data, has narrowed slightly since 1989, but remains extremely wide. The median Black family has a net worth (including cars and other durable goods) of $44,100, just 15.5 percent of the $282,310 median white wealth. The typical Latino family, with $62,120, owns just 21.8 percent of the wealth of the median white family. The Institute for Policy Studies report, Ten Solutions to Bridge the Racial Wealth Divide , offers proposals for bold, structural reforms to address this problem. Families that have zero or even “negative” wealth (meaning the value of their debts exceeds the value of their assets) live on the edge, just one minor economic setback away from tragedy. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Federal Reserve data show that while the racial wealth gap has improved slightly, an estimated 28 percent of Black households and 26 percent of Latino households had zero or negative wealth in 2019, twice the level of whites. As with total wealth, home ownership is heavily skewed towards white families, our 2023 report with the National Community Reinvestment, Still a Dream , shows. Between 1960 and 2020, the rate of Black home ownership increased but the gap in ownership rates between Black and white families widened, from 26 percentage points to 30. Structural barriers, including lower incomes, higher rates of mortgage denials, and racial segregation, deny many Black families the opportunity to acquire this wealth-building asset. Black people also have to deal with larger student debt burdens. Black students on average have to take out larger loans to get through college than their white peers. A National Center for Education Statistics study reveals that Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree graduates face 13 percent and 26 percent more student debt, respectively, than their white peers. The challenge of paying off greater student debt is also worsened for Black graduates due to their lower average incomes. Black Bachelor’s degree and Associate’s degree holders earn 27 percent and 14 percent lower incomes , respectively, than whites with the same degree. Racial Income Inequality In 2021, Fortune 500 CEOs, who earned $18.3 million on average, included just four Black and 17 Latino people — just 4 percent of the total. By contrast, these groups made up 43 percent of the U.S. workers who would benefit from a raise in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, according to Institute for Policy Studies analysis of Economic Policy Institute data. Black and Latino people comprise 31 percent of the entire U.S. labor force. The world’s wealthiest country is home to numerous communities that have been poor for generations: think parts of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the southern border, and Chicago’s South Side. An Economic Innovation Group report finds that people of color are far more likely to live in “persistently poor” communities – defined as those with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher for at least 30 years – than white Americans. Racial discrimination in many forms, including in education, hiring, and pay practices, contributes to persistent earnings gaps. As of the third quarter of 2023, the median white worker made 24 percent more than the typical Black worker and around 28 percent more than the median Latino worker, according to BLS data . Race and Gender Inequality Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. While student loan burdens have grown significantly for all racial groups, they are particularly heavy for Black students — especially women. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, 43.3 percent of Black women are shouldering student loan debts, compared to just 15.7 percent of white men. Racial inequality in terms of the official poverty rate is also particularly acute for women of color. As National Women’s Law Center research shows, while in 2019 the U.S. poverty rate for white men is 6.0 percent, it is 18 percent for Black women, 15 percent for the Latino community, and 18 percent for Native American women. Racial Inequality and Covid-19 According to APM Research Lab , white and Asian Americans have substantially lower Covid-19 mortality rates than those of other racial and ethnic groups. Between the start of the pandemic and October 2, 2022, indigenous people suffered 582 deaths per 100,000 people – more than twice the death rate for whites and Asians. People of color are more likely to suffer severe illness from Covid-19, regardless of their age. According to CDC data , hospitalization rates have been highest among indigenous and Black Americans. About 2,100 indigenous and 1,700 Black Americans were hospitalized for Covid-related symptoms per 100,000 people in their respective ethnic and race groups between the beginning of the pandemic and October 22, 2022. The racial disparities in Covid-related health indicators have contributed to a steeper decline in the U.S. life expectancy for people of color, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the CDC. Between 2019 and 2021, American Indians and Alaska natives experienced the biggest drop, with life expectancy at birth plunging by more than 6 years to 65.2. The Latino and Black communities both experienced a drop of four years, while Asian and white Americans have seen a decrease of about two years since the start of the pandemic. The pandemic-related economic crisis in 2020 was particularly devastating for people of color. When the shutdown sent unemployment levels skyrocketing in March and April of that year, Black and Latino workers were much more likely to be jobless than white workers, according to BLS data . This remained true despite the fact that people of color made up a disproportionate share of essential workers who had to remain on the job at the start of the pandemic. While the overall unemployment rate has dropped significantly, racial disparities remain. In February 2025, Black unemployment stood at 6.0 percent, compared to 3.8 percent for white workers, according to BLS data . The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the share of U.S. workers who are teleworking for health reasons, but not everyone has the same ability to work from home. According to the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Occupational Safety (NIOSH) and Health, Black and Non-white Hispanic workers are less likely to report being able to telework than white and Asian workers. Some 38 percent of Asian workers and 24 percent of white workers reported working from home between May 2020 and July 2021. By contrast, only 19 percent of Black and 14 percent and Non-white Hispanic workers reported working from home in that same time period. The researchers attributed 80 percent of this divide to racial education gaps, since college graduates are more likely to be able to telework. Workers of color with public-facing jobs have been exposed to greater virus risks.\'}]'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'parallel_tool_calls': False, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'search', 'description': 'Retrieve relevant web search results for a given query.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'reason': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Reason why this search is needed.'}, 'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'Search query string.'}}, 'required': ['reason', 'query'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}, {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'summary', 'description': 'summary retrieved data to answer the sub-question.', 'strict': True, 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'summary': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'summary of the retrieved data.'}}, 'required': ['summary'], 'additionalProperties': False}}}]}}

Racism is a complex and multifaceted issue, influenced by a combination of historical, social, cultural, psychological, and economic factors. 

Historical events, such as colonialism, slavery, and segregation, have contributed to the development of racist ideologies. Social and cultural norms also play a significant role in shaping racist attitudes, with factors like culture, race, and ethnicity influencing how individuals perceive themselves and interact with the world. 

Psychological factors, including prejudice, bias, and categorization, contribute to racism by leading to the systematic advantage of certain groups and disadvantage of others. Economic and political systems also perpetuate racial disparities and racist policies, with unequal access to education, employment, and wealth being significant issues. 

The racial wealth divide, with white households holding a disproportionate amount of wealth, and racial discrimination in education, hiring, and pay practices, contribute to persistent earnings gaps. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exacerbated racial disparities, with people of color being more likely to suffer severe illness and experience higher mortality rates. 

Understanding these factors is crucial for addressing racism in a meaningful way, and efforts such as public awareness campaigns, employee-directed programs, and advocacy for systemic change can help to create a more equitable society.
