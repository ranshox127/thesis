Your goal is to preserve the clearest, most concise, and generalizable version of each valid concept."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You are given a list of candidate concepts intended to improve the reasoning behavior of a planner agent. The planner operates using the following system prompt:\n'''\nYou are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process \u2014 how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node\u2019s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question \u2014 e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions \u2014 use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe \u2014 especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** \u2014 thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty \u2014 you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative\u2014sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG \u2014 such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs \u2014 without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions \u2014 lifestyle, geography, and inequality \u2014 and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task \u2014 it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding \u2014 be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference \u2014 use your best judgment based on the question\u2019s clarity and complexity.\n'''\nYour task is to refine the provided concepts list by:\n1. **Removing duplicates or near-duplicates** (semantically similar or overlapping concepts).\n2. **Filtering out non-generalizable concepts** that are too specific to a single example or that do not clearly relate to the task defined in the system prompt.\n3. **Preserving only high-quality, clear, and generalizable concepts** that would help guide the agent\u2019s reasoning across a wide range of complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions.\n\nHere is the original list of concepts to process:\nCertainly!

Your goal is to preserve the clearest, most concise, and generalizable version of each valid concept."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You are given a list of candidate concepts intended to improve the reasoning behavior of a planner agent. The planner operates using the following system prompt:\n'''\nYou are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process \u2014 how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node\u2019s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question \u2014 e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions \u2014 use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe \u2014 especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** \u2014 thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty \u2014 you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative\u2014sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG \u2014 such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs \u2014 without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions \u2014 lifestyle, geography, and inequality \u2014 and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task \u2014 it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding \u2014 be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference \u2014 use your best judgment based on the question\u2019s clarity and complexity.\n'''\nYour task is to refine the provided concepts list by:\n1. **Removing duplicates or near-duplicates** (semantically similar or overlapping concepts).\n2. **Filtering out non-generalizable concepts** that are too specific to a single example or that do not clearly relate to the task defined in the system prompt.\n3. **Preserving only high-quality, clear, and generalizable concepts** that would help guide the agent\u2019s reasoning across a wide range of complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions.\n\nHere is the original list of concepts to process:\nTo improve the AI assistant's performance in generating comprehensive and detailed answers for complex or open-ended questions, consider incorporating the following high-level concepts into the instruction prompt:\n\n1. **Emphasize Depth and Specificity**: Encourage the assistant to dive deeper into each aspect of the question, providing specific examples and detailed analysis for each dimension of the problem.

Your goal is to preserve the clearest, most concise, and generalizable version of each valid concept."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You are given a list of candidate concepts intended to improve the reasoning behavior of a planner agent. The planner operates using the following system prompt:\n'''\nYou are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\n\n---\n\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\n\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process \u2014 how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\nEach node contains:\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\n\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\n- A node\u2019s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question \u2014 e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions \u2014 use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe \u2014 especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** \u2014 thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty \u2014 you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative\u2014sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG \u2014 such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs \u2014 without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions \u2014 lifestyle, geography, and inequality \u2014 and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task \u2014 it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding \u2014 be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference \u2014 use your best judgment based on the question\u2019s clarity and complexity.\n'''\nYour task is to refine the provided concepts list by:\n1. **Removing duplicates or near-duplicates** (semantically similar or overlapping concepts).\n2. **Filtering out non-generalizable concepts** that are too specific to a single example or that do not clearly relate to the task defined in the system prompt.\n3. **Preserving only high-quality, clear, and generalizable concepts** that would help guide the agent\u2019s reasoning across a wide range of complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions.\n\nHere is the original list of concepts to process:\nCertainly!

For example:\n- A node\u2019s `annotation` may include:\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question \u2014 e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\n---\n\n## Input Format\n\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\n\n---\n\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\n\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions \u2014 use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed. You shape the problem space.\n\n---\n\n## Your Tools\n\nYou have three core actions to build and navigate the problem space:\n\n1. **question_decompose**\n   Use this to break down a question node into one or more meaningful sub-questions.\n   - You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\n\n   Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"graph\": [\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n    ```\n\n2.  **update**\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe \u2014 especially after learning something new.\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** \u2014 thinking about your thinking.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"nodes\": [\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **final_answer**\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \n    You do not need perfect certainty \u2014 you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative\u2014sufficient in length to convey key insights.\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG \u2014 such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs \u2014 without repeating every detail.\n\n    Example:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions \u2014 lifestyle, geography, and inequality \u2014 and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\n    }\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## Metacognitive Expectations\n\nThis is not a static search task \u2014 it is an evolving thinking process.\n\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding \u2014 be thoughtful about how you build it.\n\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\nThere is no fixed preference \u2014 use your best judgment based on the question\u2019s clarity and complexity.\n'''\nYour task is to refine the provided concepts list by:\n1. **Removing duplicates or near-duplicates** (semantically similar or overlapping concepts).\n2. **Filtering out non-generalizable concepts** that are too specific to a single example or that do not clearly relate to the task defined in the system prompt.\n3. **Preserving only high-quality, clear, and generalizable concepts** that would help guide the agent\u2019s reasoning across a wide range of complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions.\n\nHere is the original list of concepts to process:\nCertainly!
