But it doesn’t need to. A new global analysis of progress on gender equality and women’s rights shows women and girls remain disproportionately affected by the socioeconomic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, struggling with disproportionately high job and livelihood losses, education disruptions and increased burdens of unpaid care work. Women’s health services, poorly funded even before the pandemic, faced major disruptions, undermining women’s sexual and reproductive health. And despite women’s central role in responding to COVID-19, including as front-line health workers, they are still largely bypassed for leadership positions they deserve. VIDEO UN Women’s latest report, together with UN DESA, Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2021 presents the latest data on gender equality across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The report highlights the progress made since 2015 but also the continued alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic, its immediate effect on women’s well-being and the threat it poses to future generations. We’re breaking down some of the findings from the report, and calling for the action needed to accelerate progress. The pandemic is making matters worse One and a half years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the toll on the poorest and most vulnerable people remains devastating and disproportionate. The combined impact of conflict, extreme weather events and COVID-19 has deprived women and girls of even basic needs such as food security. Without urgent action to stem rising poverty, hunger and inequality, especially in countries affected by conflict and other acute forms of crisis, millions will continue to suffer. A global goal by global goal reality check: Goal 1. Poverty In 2021, extreme poverty is on the rise and progress towards its elimination has reversed. An estimated 435 million women and girls globally are living in extreme poverty. And yet we can change this . Over 150 million women and girls could emerge from poverty by 2030 if governments implement a comprehensive strategy to improve access to education and family planning, achieve equal wages and extend social transfers. Goal 2. Zero hunger The global gender gap in food security has risen dramatically during the pandemic, with more women and girls going hungry. Women’s food insecurity levels were 10 per cent higher than men’s in 2020, compared with 6 per cent higher in 2019. This trend can be reversed , including by supporting women small-scale producers, who typically earn far less than men, through increased funding, training and land rights reforms. Goal 3. Good health and well-being Disruptions in essential health services due to COVID-19 are taking a tragic toll on women and girls. In the first year of the pandemic, there were an estimated 1.4 million additional unintended pregnancies in lower and middle-income countries. We need to do better . Response to the pandemic must include prioritizing sexual and reproductive health services, ensuring they continue to operate safely now and after the pandemic is long over. In addition, more support is needed to ensure life-saving personal protection equipment, tests, oxygen and especially vaccines are available in rich and poor countries alike as well as to vulnerable population within countries. Goal 4. Quality education A year and a half into the pandemic, schools remain partially or fully closed in 42 per cent of the world’s countries and territories. School closures spell lost opportunities for girls and an increased risk of violence, exploitation and early marriage . Governments can do more to protect girls education . Measures focused specifically on supporting girls returning to school are urgently needed, including measures focused on girls from marginalized communities who are most at risk. Goal 5. Gender equality The pandemic has tested and even reversed progress in expanding women’s rights and opportunities. Reports of violence against women and girls, a “shadow” pandemic to COVID-19, are increasing in many parts of the world. COVID-19 is also intensifying women’s workload at home, forcing many to leave the labour force altogether. And yet we can change this . Building forward differently and better will hinge on placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting. Goal 6. Clean water and sanitation In 2018, nearly 2.3 billion people lived in water-stressed countries. Without safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and menstrual hygiene facilities, women and girls find it harder to lead safe, productive and healthy lives. Change is possible . Involve those most impacted in water management processes, including women. Women’s voices are often missing in water management processes. Goal 7. Affordable and clean energy Increased demand for clean energy and low-carbon solutions is driving an unprecedented transformation of the energy sector. But women are being left out. Women hold only 32 per cent of renewable energy jobs. We can do better . Expose girls early on to STEM education, provide training and support to women entering the energy field, close the pay gap and increase women’s leadership in the energy sector. Goal 8. Decent work and economic growth The number of employed women declined by 54 million in 2020 and 45 million women left the labour market altogether. Women have suffered steeper job losses than men, along with increased unpaid care burdens at home. We must do more to support women in the workforce . Guarantee decent work for all, introduce labour laws/reforms, removing legal barriers for married women entering the workforce, support access to affordable/quality childcare. Goal 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure The COVID-19 crisis has spurred striking achievements in medical research and innovation. Women’s contribution has been profound. But still only a little over a third of graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field are female. We can take action today. Quotas mandating that a proportion of research grants are awarded to women-led teams or teams that include women is one concrete way to support women researchers. Goal 10. Reduced inequalities Limited progress for women is being eroded by the pandemic. Women facing multiple forms of discrimination, including women and girls with disabilities, migrant women, women discriminated against because of their race/ethnicity are especially affected. We need to do better . Commit to end racism and discrimination in all its forms, invest in inclusive, universal, gender responsive social protection systems that support all women. Goal 11. Sustainable cities and communities Globally, more than 1 billion people live in informal settlements and slums. Women and girls, often overrepresented in these densely populated areas, suffer from lack of access to basic water and sanitation, health care and transportation. The needs of urban poor women must be prioritized . Increase the provision of durable and adequate housing and equitable access to land; included women in urban planning and development processes. Goal 12. Sustainable consumption and production; Goal 13. Climate action; Goal 14. Life below water; and Goal 15. Life on land Women activists, scientists and researchers are working hard to solve the climate crisis but often without the same platforms as men to share their knowledge and skills. Only 29 per cent of featured speakers at international ocean science conferences are women. And yet we can change this . Ensure women activists, scientists and researchers have equal voice, representation and access to forums where these issues are being discussed and debated. Goal 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions The lack of women in decision-making limits the reach and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergency recovery efforts. In conflict-affected countries, 18.9 per cent of parliamentary seats are held by women, much lower than the global average of 25.6 per cent. This is unacceptable . It's time for women to have an equal share of power and decision-making at all levels. Goal 17. Global partnerships for the goals There are just 9 years left to achieve the Global Goals by 2030, and gender equality cuts across all 17 of them. With COVID-19 slowing progress on women's rights, the time to act is now. Looking ahead As it stands today, only one indicator under the global goal for gender equality (SDG5) is ‘close to target’: proportion of seats held by women in local government. In other areas critical to women’s empowerment, equality in time spent on unpaid care and domestic work and decision making regarding sexual and reproductive health the world is far from target. Without a bold commitment to accelerate progress, the global community will fail to achieve gender equality. Building forward differently and better will require placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting."}, {'title': "The 11 biggest hurdles for women's equality by 2030", 'url': 'https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/feature-story/2023/09/the-11-biggest-hurdles-for-womens-equality-by-2030', 'content': "1. Lack of women in leadership With just 27 per cent of parliamentary seats, 36 per cent of local government seats, and 28 per cent of management positions held by women, there is a lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making processes, hindering comprehensive policy formulation. 2. Poverty and lack of economic opportunities More than 340 million women and girls are projected to live in extreme poverty by 2030. This represents a staggering 8 per cent of the global female population surviving on less than USD 2.15 a day. Social protections, access to decent work, and other support systems are urgently needed to provide a path out of poverty. 3. Workplace discrimination and inequalities Only 61 per cent of prime working-age women participate in the labour force, compared to 91 per cent of prime working-age men. This affects both economic growth and societal progress. In 2019, for each dollar men earned in labour income, women earned only 51 cents. 4. An imbalance in unpaid care work On the current trajectory, the gap between the time spent by women and men on unpaid care will narrow slightly, but by 2050, women globally will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time (2.3 more hours per day) on unpaid care work than men. This persistent gap limits women’s participation in education, employment, and other opportunities. 5. Social norms and cultural practices Harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation persist. Globally, one in five young women is married before age 18. The prevalence of child marriage highlights the need for attitudinal shifts and the promotion of legal frameworks that safeguard women and girls’ rights. 6. Inadequate access to education and health care An estimated 110 million girls and young women may remain out of school by 2030. Stalled progress in reducing maternal mortality and expanding educational opportunities call for targeted interventions to meet the 2030 goals. 7. Food insecurity Nearly 24 per cent of women and girls are expected to experience moderate to severe food insecurity by 2030. Empowering women in food and agricultural systems by enhancing access to land and resources is vital for ensuring food security and economic growth. 8. Violence against women and girls Each year, 245 million women and girls experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Older women also face higher rates of poverty and violence than older men. 9. Inadequate funding for gender equality initiatives Only 4 per cent of total bilateral aid is allocated to gender equality and women's empowerment. The additional investment needed for achieving gender equality by 2030 is estimated at USD 360 billion per year. 10. Legal barriers and poorly enforced legislation At least 28 countries do not have laws granting women equal rights to enter marriage and initiate divorce, and 67 countries lack laws prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination against women. Where legislation does exist to promote gender equality, effective implementation remains a challenge. 11. Lack of access to clean energy and sanitation An estimated 341 million women and girls are projected to lack electricity by 2030. Universal access could significantly reduce poverty and improve women’s health. With just seven years remaining to achieve the 2030 targets, concerted efforts and funding are more necessary than ever. Each step forward, no matter how incremental, brings us closer to a future where gender equality is not just a goal, but a reality."}, {'title': 'Gender equality will take 300 years to achieve, UN chief warns', 'url': 'https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/world/un-gender-equality-300-years-intl-hnk/index.html', 'content': 'CNN — Progress toward gender equality is “vanishing before our eyes,” United Nations Secretary General António Guterres told the Commission on the Status of Women on Monday. Speaking to the key UN women’s rights group ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8, Guterres said gender equality is “300 years away” according to the latest estimates from UN Women, the UN organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. Guterres cited high rates of maternal mortality, girls being forced into early marriage, and girls being kidnapped and assaulted for attending school as evidence that hope of achieving gender equality “is growing more distant.” In his speech, Guterres did not mention Iran, which was expelled from the 45-member commission in December over protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s so-called “morality police.” “Women’s rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world,” Guterres said, naming a few countries in particular, including Afghanistan, where he said “women and girls have been erased from public life.” On Monday, young Afghan women gathered outside Kabul University to protest the ruling Taliban’s ban on female education, a restriction which a new UN report says may amount to “a crime against humanity.” The report presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday also noted the rise in forced and child marriages, the ban excluding women from other public spaces like parks and gyms, and other restrictions limiting women’s ability to work and travel independently in Afghanistan. Guterres said the deputy secretary-general and the executive director of UN Women recently visited Afghanistan and conveyed to the Taliban authorities that “we will never give up fighting for” women and girls. “Crisis and conflict affect women and girls first and worst,” Guterres said, including the war in Ukraine as an example. Last year, the UN called for an investigation into reports of rape and sexual violence against Ukrainian women and children following Russia’s invasion. Guterres also said that “in many places, women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back,” though he didn’t specify where. Last June, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to abortion up to individual states. The year before, a ban on abortions due to fetal defects took effect in Poland – essentially ending almost all abortions in the country. To achieve gender equality, Guterres called for “collective” and “urgent” action, from increasing education, income and employment for women and girls, especially in developing nations in the Global South, to promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology. “Centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and harmful stereotypes have created a huge gender gap in science and technology,” Guterres said. “Let’s be clear: global frameworks are not working for the world’s women and girls. They need to change.”'}, {'title': 'Gender inequality in the United States - statistics & facts', 'url': 'https://www.statista.com/topics/11801/gender-inequality-in-the-united-states/', 'content': 'Gender inequalities exist around the world, including in the United States. Although women make up of the U.S. population, they remain minorities within the most elite sectors of society; as of 2023, women constituted of the House of Representatives, the Senate, Fortune 500 CEOs, and governors nationwide. Yet, any female presence in such positions of power demonstrates progress towards the advancement of women’s rights compared to a century ago. Traditionally, American women were excluded from paid work and politics, their capabilities believed to be limited to childcare and housekeeping, while men were seen as the ideal workers without such distractions. Despite subsequent expansion of surrounding gender roles still devalue women’s work to this day. In comparison to men, women in the U.S. . Simultaneously, even though women surpass men on , and even if a woman has a higher degree than a man, it is still likely that the man will Is the future of politics female? According to the 2023 Global Gender Gap report, the United States ranked only 43rd out of 146 countries examined for gender equality by the World Economic Forum, trailing behind neighboring countries Canada and Mexico, who came in 30th and 33rd respectively. The report outlined how the U.S. lost points due to declines in women’s life expectancy and in the amount of women in senior and ministerial positions, although the share of parliamentary positions held by women has increased overall. While high political offices remain dominated by men, more women can now be found in Congress , the House of Representatives and the Senate than ever before. Moreover, despite still lacking a female head of state, Kamala Harris was appointed as the first female Vice President in 2021, suggesting positive trends for female representation in leadership positions in the future. However, a 2023 study found over half of Americans to believe that a major reason behind why there are fewer women than men in high political offices is that women have to do more to prove themselves while a further 44 percent cited that family responsibilities make it harder for women to run for office, demonstrating how lingering assumptions on female capabilities may hinder future advancement of women in American politics. In addition, the study revealed how 50 percent of Americans said that a major reason that women earn less, on average, than men, is that women are treated differently by employers and 42 percent agreed that it was because women tend to make different choices between balancing work and family, further supporting the theory that gender equality in the U.S. remains restricted by outdated gender stereotypes and expectations . A dual burden for mothers Despite having the highest GDP in the world, the United States remains the only OECD country to not offer any form of national paid leave. Even more concerningly, the United States is the only country apart from Papua New Guinea to not offer new mothers some sort of paid maternity leave , instead providing eligible employees with a modest 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for family or medical reasons. However, as women are more likely to work part-time than men, they are therefore less likely to meet eligibility requirements for unpaid leave. Additionally, research has revealed that management and professional occupations provide the most access to paid family leave for their employees, occupations which tend to be dominated by men. As a result, women may struggle to remain in the workforce if they choose to start a family, particularly as studies have shown that outsourcing childcare in the United States is generally considered unaffordable for most families. The high costs of childcare and lack of paid leave mean that many working women in the U.S. must balance work and family responsibilities without assistance, a dual burden which is especially exacerbated for low-income families and single mothers. According to the literature, mothers in the U.S. are often forced to work in low-wage occupations with certain incentives, such as flexible hours, part-time work, and supplied childcare, all of which are rare among higher wage careers. Consequently, single mothers, lacking dual income, tend to be at greater risk of experiencing poverty; comparison of the overall U.S. poverty rate with that of the poverty rate for families who only have a female head of household reveals that poverty is much more prevalent in the latter. As children in the United States are significantly more likely to live with a single mother than a single father , further attention should be given to ensuring that women in such situations can provide for their families and so that mothers nationwide can participate wholly in society, regardless of their assigned gender.

In the United States and around the world, women continue to be underrepresented in high-level, highly paid positions and overrepresented in low-paying jobs. Women of color and transgender individuals experience particularly high levels of poverty, unemployment, and other economic hardships. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace contribute significantly to these persistent economic divides. Gender Income Gaps As of June 2023, the CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations included 52 women – just 10.4 percent of an elite group that earned $16.7 million on average in 2022 . By contrast, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 67.9 percent of workers earning the federal minimum wage, a rate stuck at $7.25 since 2009. Men particularly dominate highly lucrative financial industry jobs. According to Institute for Policy Studies analysis , the share of the five largest U.S. investment banks’ senior executives and top managers who are male: JPMorgan Chase: 71 percent , Goldman Sachs: 77 percent , Bank of America: 63 percent , Morgan Stanley: 76 percent , and Citigroup: 62 percent . Nationwide, men make up 62 percent of all securities industry employees but just a tiny fraction of workers who provide care services that are in high demand but continue to be very low paid. Men make up less than 6 percent of childcare workers, an occupation that pays $26,680 per year , on average. Men make up just 13 percent of home health aides, who average $29,260 per year. The gender gaps at the top of corporate hierarchies are a global phenomenon. According to World Economic Forum analysis of LinkedIn data, women worldwide continue to be outnumbered by men in senior leadership positions across all industries. Overall, women made up just 32.2 percent of senior leadership positions in 2022, nearly 10 percentage points lower than women’s total workforce representation of 41.9 percent. Men make up an overwhelming majority of top earners across the U.S. economy, even though women now represent almost half of the country’s workforce. Women comprise just 27 percent of the top 10 percent, and their share of higher income groups runs even smaller. Among the top 1 percent, women make up slightly less than 17 percent of workers, while at the top 0.1 percent level, they make up only 11 percent, according to a research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research . Other major economies show similar trend lines. A study of eight high-income countries from the London School of Economics found that women made up just 14 percent to 22 percent of the top 1 percent of earners. These surveys were conducted during the 2010-2014 period. The U.S. figure for 2012 is from the National Bureau of Economic Research . Throughout the U.S. workforce, women remain vastly underpaid. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Data finds that among full-time workers, women earned an average of 83 cents for every dollar a man earned in 2021, up from 76 cents in 2001. The narrowing of the pay gap has slowed in the past two decades compared to earlier decades when women were joining the workforce in large numbers. If part-time workers were included in these calculations, the gap would be even wider, since women are more likely to work reduced schedules, often in order to manage childbearing and other caregiving work. Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. American women earn less than men in all industries. The largest pay gaps are in financial and insurance positions, where median earnings for men stood at $103,707 in 2022, compared to just $62,214 for women. The smallest gap appears in the construction sector, but women make up only 10.8 percent of workers in this industry. The U.S. gender pay gap, while unacceptably large, is not the world’s widest. But accurately measuring these gaps across countries can be difficult. Within the OECD group of higher-income nations, South Korea holds the widest gap, with men earning 37 percent more than women, on average. The country with the narrowest gap: Luxembourg, where men make just 3.4 percent more than women. Gaps have been smallest in OECD countries where the share of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements hits at least 80 percent and widest in countries with weak collective bargaining and no or very low minimum wages. The International Labor Organization concedes that more work needs to be done to develop more accurate global gender gap analyses. One factor skewing the numbers: Women do considerably more unpaid work, from housekeeping to caring for children and the elderly. Among the 21 countries reporting data for at least one year during the 2013-2015 period, the West Bank and Gaza had the greatest imbalance, with men devoting just 16 percent as much time to unpaid domestic and caregiving work as women. Belgium, where men spend 63 percent as much time on these activities as women, ranked at the top. Since 2017, the UK government has required corporations with more than 250 employees to disclose the pay gaps between the men and women on their payrolls. Large financial firms have among the widest divides because of the scarcity of women in top positions. In 2022, Goldman Sachs International reported the biggest gap in this sector, with women making just 48.7 cents on average for every $1 earned by men at the bank. Gender Wealth Gaps Most inequality analysis focuses on income (the wages earned from a job or from capital gains) rather than wealth (the sum of one’s assets minus debts). Income inequality, while stark, pales in comparison to wealth inequality. The divides become even more dramatic when viewed through a gender lens. At the top end, we have no more striking sign of increasing global wealth concentration than the rise of the billionaire class . The number of individuals with fortunes worth at least $1 billion has more than doubled since 2010 , while remaining overwhelmingly male. As of March 1, 2023, only 298 women ranked among the world’s 2,489 billionaires, accounting for less than 12 percent. Ninety-one of them hail from the United States, nearly double the number in any other country. The retirement gap is a key factor in our country’s gender inequality. According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies , American women in late 2022 held $44,000 in median retirement savings, compared to $91,000 for men. The gender pay gap contributes to these disparities, since both pension plan and Social Security payouts are partially based on past earnings. In December 2022, women’s average annual Social Security benefit of $19,656 lagged the benefit for men by $4,584. Women’s smaller retirement nest eggs also have to stretch further because women have longer life expectancies. Debt also significantly impacts wealth. Crushing student loan debts drag many young Americans far into the negative side of the wealth line, with women bearing the heaviest burdens. Women comprise 56 percent of college students, but hold nearly two-thirds of outstanding student loan debt, according to the American Association of University Women . Black, Hispanic, and white women are more likely to have student debt than men in their racial or ethnic group. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, Black women are most likely to be shouldering this financial burden. More than 43 percent of this group have student loan debt, compared to less than 16 percent of white men. Gender Poverty Gaps The gender poverty gap has not improved significantly over the past half decade. In 1966, 12.1 percent of women and 8.4 percent of men aged 18-64 lived below the official poverty line. In 2023, 11.2 percent of women in this age group were living in poverty, compared to 8.8 percent of men. In 2023, the poverty threshold for a single person was $14,580 in annual income. Households led by single women with children faced poverty rates of 21.8 percent that year, nearly double the 11.4 percent poverty rate for households led by single men with children, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . Poverty is a particularly acute problem for women of color. In 2023, Native American women had the highest official poverty rate, at 20.4 percent – three times the 6.8 percent poverty rate for white American men. Black women had the second-highest poverty rate, at 16.8 percent, according to the National Women’s Law Center . Transgender Economic Gaps According to a KFF/Washington Post Trans Survey , a larger share of trans adults report being unemployed (14 percent vs. 8 percent) compared to cisgender (non-trans) adults. These findings reflect the significant barriers trans individuals already face in employment access and opportunity. In the National Center for Transgender Equality’s 2022 U.S Trans Survey , more than one in ten (11 percent) of respondents who had ever held a job said they had been fired, forced to resign, or laid off because of their gender identity or expression. People in the LGBTQ+ community tend to earn significantly less than the typical U.S. worker. Transgender women experience the largest gap, earning only 60 cents for every dollar earned by the typical U.S. worker, according to Human Rights Campaign analysis . Trans men earn just 70 percent of U.S. median pay. This analysis focuses only on full-time workers, meaning the wage gap for transgender individuals may be even larger, since they are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. Transgender individuals also experience exceptionally high poverty rates. The Williams Institute at the UCLA Law School analyzed results from CDC surveys conducted between 2014 and 2017. They found that the overall poverty rate among trans people stood at 29.4 percent — nearly twice the 15.7 percent poverty rate among cisgender straight people. Racial and gender disparities further exacerbate the disparities. The Williams Institute found that 38.5 percent of Black transgender and 48.4 percent of Latinx transgender adults were experiencing poverty. White cis-straight men had by far the lowest poverty rate, at just 7.6 percent. Inequality and Reproductive Rights The impact of the Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade will be most severe for low-income people in states with long histories of restricting abortions. As shown by Economic Policy Institute research , many of the states with either trigger laws (which automatically banned abortion upon Roe’s overturn) or pre-Roe abortion bans or restrictions are also states that have not raised their state minimum wage above the federal floor or have rejected federal support to allow Medicaid expansion. Eight states – Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi – have both rejected Medicaid expansion and have a $7.25 minimum wage. Inequality Across Gender Diversity and Covid-19 The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-standing gender inequalities. Women are more likely than men to work in service occupations, including domestic work, restaurant service, retail, tourism, and hospitality, that require face-to-face interactions and have been hard-hit by layoffs. Because of the nature of these jobs, teleworking is not an option for many women. Frontline jobs, which are the ones most often deemed “essential” and require people to work in-person, are also heavily staffed by women. The health care, social work, and government and community-based services occupations are overwhelmingly made up of women, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute . Women make up 73 percent of government and community-based services workers, 76 percent of health care workers, and 78 percent of social workers. The official U.S. unemployment rate does not include people who have not looked for work in the past four weeks. Because women tend to bear more responsibility for family caregiving, women with children were more likely than men to drop out of the labor force when schools and care centers closed due to Covid. Rand Corporation research reveals that the steepest decline in labor force participation in the first phase of the pandemic was among women with two children, at 3.82 points, compared to a 1.39 point drop for men with two children. More recently, the shortage of affordable childcare services has emerged as a barrier for women in returning to jobs in restaurants and other low-wage sectors, contributing to staffing challenges. Among U.S. women who’ve stopped looking for work during the pandemic, the steepest drops have been among women of color. Between February 2020 and November 2021, Black women had a 3.5 percentage point drop in labor force participation and Latinx women had a 2.8 point drop, compared to 1.7 for white women. Several factors may have contributed to women of color becoming discouraged from seeking work. On top of gender inequities, women of color face racial discrimination in hiring and layoffs and they are disproportionately concentrated in service and care sector jobs with high risks of Covid exposure. Transgender people are always in a precarious position, but the Covid-19 pandemic has made them particularly vulnerable. According to research from the Williams Institute at UCLA , transgender Americans are at a higher risk for Covid-19 for several reasons. They are more likely to be low-income, with 47.7 percent of transgender people living below 200 percent of the official U.S. poverty line, compared to 28.9 percent of the general U.S. population. They are also significantly more likely to suffer from asthma and HIV, conditions that put people at higher risk of mortality if they contract Covid-19. And they experience high barriers to receiving health care. The pandemic has also hit transgender Americans especially hard economically. A poll from the Human Rights Campaign and PSB Research shows that as of June 2020, 54 percent of transgender people had experienced reduced work hours — more than double the 23 percent of the total U.S. workforce that faced a similar reduction. Twenty-seven percent of transgender people had experienced pay cuts, compared to just 7 percent of the U.S. workforce. And 19 percent had become unemployed due to the pandemic, a significantly larger share than the general population.'}, {'title': "Women's rights are under attack 30 years after leaders adopted a ...", 'url': 'https://apnews.com/article/un-women-girls-equality-beijing-conference-rights-b009715ff605ccf47f1b72865c7a27e7', 'content': 'UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Thirty years after world leaders adopted a historic blueprint to achieve gender equality, a new United Nations report says women’s and girls’ rights are under attack and gender discrimination remains deeply embedded in economies and societies. The report released Thursday by the U.N. agency focused on women’s rights and gender equality found that nearly one-quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash to women’s rights last year. The number of countries reporting a backlash is likely underreported and reflects “an increasingly hostile environment,” UN Women’s policy and program director Sarah Hendriks said at a news conference. “It is not a new phenomenon,” she said. “What is new is that it’s gaining in greater speed and scale and velocity,” especially in very patriarchal and traditional nations where men play a dominant role. The 35 countries reporting a backlash on gender equality came from across the globe and include Spain, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia, Australia, Mongolia, South Africa, Mali and Zimbabwe. Despite some progress, including on girls’ education and access to family planning, UN Women said a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a partner or family member and that cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased by 50% since 2022. The report, released ahead of International Women’s Day on Saturday, also noted that only 87 countries have ever been led by a woman. “Globally, women’s human rights are under attack,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “Instead of mainstreaming equal rights, we’re seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny.” He said the world must stand firm “in making human rights, equality and empowerment a reality for all women and girls, for everyone, everywhere.” The 189 countries that attended a 1995 Beijing women’s conference adopted a landmark declaration and 150-page platform for action to achieve gender equality, calling for bold action in 12 areas, including combating poverty and gender-based violence and putting women at top levels in business, government and at peacemaking tables. It also said for the first time in a U.N. document that human rights include the right of women to control and decide “on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.” In the new review, which includes contributions from 159 countries, UN Women said countries have taken many steps forward on gender equality and women’s rights in the past five years but that such rights still are facing growing threats worldwide. On the positive side , the report said some 88% of countries have passed laws to combat violence against women and established services to help victims in the past five years. Most countries have banned workplace discrimination, and 44% are improving the quality of education and training for girls and women, it said. Yet gender discrimination is deeply embedded, with wide gaps in power and resources that restrain women’s rights, the report said. “The weakening of democratic institutions has gone hand in hand with backlash on gender equality,” UN Women said. It warned that “anti-rights actors are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues” and seeking to block or slow legal and policy gains they can’t roll back. UN Women said almost 25% of countries reported that backlash on gender equality is hampering implementation of the Beijing platform. According to the report, women have only 64% of the legal rights of men, and while the proportion of female lawmakers has more than doubled since 1995, three-quarters of lawmakers are still men. UN Women also said women aged 15 to 24 lag behind other age groups on access to modern family planning; maternal mortality ratios have remained almost unchanged since 2015; and 10% of women and girls live in extremely poor households. The U.N. agency said cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased 50% since 2022 — and women and girls are victims of 95% of these crimes. UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said that based on the report’s findings, the agency has adopted a roadmap to bring the world closer to the U.N. goal of achieving gender equality by 2030. It calls for a digital revolution ensuring equal access to technology for all women and girls; investments in social protections, including universal health care and quality education to lift them out of poverty; and zero violence against girls and women. The roadmap also includes equal decision-making power for women and financing for “gender-responsive humanitarian aid” in conflicts and crises. ___ Lederer was AP’s lead reporter at the 1995 U.N. women’s conference in Beijing.'}]

But it doesn’t need to. A new global analysis of progress on gender equality and women’s rights shows women and girls remain disproportionately affected by the socioeconomic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, struggling with disproportionately high job and livelihood losses, education disruptions and increased burdens of unpaid care work. Women’s health services, poorly funded even before the pandemic, faced major disruptions, undermining women’s sexual and reproductive health. And despite women’s central role in responding to COVID-19, including as front-line health workers, they are still largely bypassed for leadership positions they deserve. VIDEO UN Women’s latest report, together with UN DESA, Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2021 presents the latest data on gender equality across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The report highlights the progress made since 2015 but also the continued alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic, its immediate effect on women’s well-being and the threat it poses to future generations. We’re breaking down some of the findings from the report, and calling for the action needed to accelerate progress. The pandemic is making matters worse One and a half years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the toll on the poorest and most vulnerable people remains devastating and disproportionate. The combined impact of conflict, extreme weather events and COVID-19 has deprived women and girls of even basic needs such as food security. Without urgent action to stem rising poverty, hunger and inequality, especially in countries affected by conflict and other acute forms of crisis, millions will continue to suffer. A global goal by global goal reality check: Goal 1. Poverty In 2021, extreme poverty is on the rise and progress towards its elimination has reversed. An estimated 435 million women and girls globally are living in extreme poverty. And yet we can change this . Over 150 million women and girls could emerge from poverty by 2030 if governments implement a comprehensive strategy to improve access to education and family planning, achieve equal wages and extend social transfers. Goal 2. Zero hunger The global gender gap in food security has risen dramatically during the pandemic, with more women and girls going hungry. Women’s food insecurity levels were 10 per cent higher than men’s in 2020, compared with 6 per cent higher in 2019. This trend can be reversed , including by supporting women small-scale producers, who typically earn far less than men, through increased funding, training and land rights reforms. Goal 3. Good health and well-being Disruptions in essential health services due to COVID-19 are taking a tragic toll on women and girls. In the first year of the pandemic, there were an estimated 1.4 million additional unintended pregnancies in lower and middle-income countries. We need to do better . Response to the pandemic must include prioritizing sexual and reproductive health services, ensuring they continue to operate safely now and after the pandemic is long over. In addition, more support is needed to ensure life-saving personal protection equipment, tests, oxygen and especially vaccines are available in rich and poor countries alike as well as to vulnerable population within countries. Goal 4. Quality education A year and a half into the pandemic, schools remain partially or fully closed in 42 per cent of the world’s countries and territories. School closures spell lost opportunities for girls and an increased risk of violence, exploitation and early marriage . Governments can do more to protect girls education . Measures focused specifically on supporting girls returning to school are urgently needed, including measures focused on girls from marginalized communities who are most at risk. Goal 5. Gender equality The pandemic has tested and even reversed progress in expanding women’s rights and opportunities. Reports of violence against women and girls, a “shadow” pandemic to COVID-19, are increasing in many parts of the world. COVID-19 is also intensifying women’s workload at home, forcing many to leave the labour force altogether. And yet we can change this . Building forward differently and better will hinge on placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting. Goal 6. Clean water and sanitation In 2018, nearly 2.3 billion people lived in water-stressed countries. Without safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and menstrual hygiene facilities, women and girls find it harder to lead safe, productive and healthy lives. Change is possible . Involve those most impacted in water management processes, including women. Women’s voices are often missing in water management processes. Goal 7. Affordable and clean energy Increased demand for clean energy and low-carbon solutions is driving an unprecedented transformation of the energy sector. But women are being left out. Women hold only 32 per cent of renewable energy jobs. We can do better . Expose girls early on to STEM education, provide training and support to women entering the energy field, close the pay gap and increase women’s leadership in the energy sector. Goal 8. Decent work and economic growth The number of employed women declined by 54 million in 2020 and 45 million women left the labour market altogether. Women have suffered steeper job losses than men, along with increased unpaid care burdens at home. We must do more to support women in the workforce . Guarantee decent work for all, introduce labour laws/reforms, removing legal barriers for married women entering the workforce, support access to affordable/quality childcare. Goal 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure The COVID-19 crisis has spurred striking achievements in medical research and innovation. Women’s contribution has been profound. But still only a little over a third of graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field are female. We can take action today. Quotas mandating that a proportion of research grants are awarded to women-led teams or teams that include women is one concrete way to support women researchers. Goal 10. Reduced inequalities Limited progress for women is being eroded by the pandemic. Women facing multiple forms of discrimination, including women and girls with disabilities, migrant women, women discriminated against because of their race/ethnicity are especially affected. We need to do better . Commit to end racism and discrimination in all its forms, invest in inclusive, universal, gender responsive social protection systems that support all women. Goal 11. Sustainable cities and communities Globally, more than 1 billion people live in informal settlements and slums. Women and girls, often overrepresented in these densely populated areas, suffer from lack of access to basic water and sanitation, health care and transportation. The needs of urban poor women must be prioritized . Increase the provision of durable and adequate housing and equitable access to land; included women in urban planning and development processes. Goal 12. Sustainable consumption and production; Goal 13. Climate action; Goal 14. Life below water; and Goal 15. Life on land Women activists, scientists and researchers are working hard to solve the climate crisis but often without the same platforms as men to share their knowledge and skills. Only 29 per cent of featured speakers at international ocean science conferences are women. And yet we can change this . Ensure women activists, scientists and researchers have equal voice, representation and access to forums where these issues are being discussed and debated. Goal 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions The lack of women in decision-making limits the reach and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergency recovery efforts. In conflict-affected countries, 18.9 per cent of parliamentary seats are held by women, much lower than the global average of 25.6 per cent. This is unacceptable . It\'s time for women to have an equal share of power and decision-making at all levels. Goal 17. Global partnerships for the goals There are just 9 years left to achieve the Global Goals by 2030, and gender equality cuts across all 17 of them. With COVID-19 slowing progress on women\'s rights, the time to act is now. Looking ahead As it stands today, only one indicator under the global goal for gender equality (SDG5) is ‘close to target’: proportion of seats held by women in local government. In other areas critical to women’s empowerment, equality in time spent on unpaid care and domestic work and decision making regarding sexual and reproductive health the world is far from target. Without a bold commitment to accelerate progress, the global community will fail to achieve gender equality. Building forward differently and better will require placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting."}, {\'title\': "The 11 biggest hurdles for women\'s equality by 2030", \'url\': \'https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/feature-story/2023/09/the-11-biggest-hurdles-for-womens-equality-by-2030\', \'content\': "1. Lack of women in leadership With just 27 per cent of parliamentary seats, 36 per cent of local government seats, and 28 per cent of management positions held by women, there is a lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making processes, hindering comprehensive policy formulation. 2. Poverty and lack of economic opportunities More than 340 million women and girls are projected to live in extreme poverty by 2030. This represents a staggering 8 per cent of the global female population surviving on less than USD 2.15 a day. Social protections, access to decent work, and other support systems are urgently needed to provide a path out of poverty. 3. Workplace discrimination and inequalities Only 61 per cent of prime working-age women participate in the labour force, compared to 91 per cent of prime working-age men. This affects both economic growth and societal progress. In 2019, for each dollar men earned in labour income, women earned only 51 cents. 4. An imbalance in unpaid care work On the current trajectory, the gap between the time spent by women and men on unpaid care will narrow slightly, but by 2050, women globally will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time (2.3 more hours per day) on unpaid care work than men. This persistent gap limits women’s participation in education, employment, and other opportunities. 5. Social norms and cultural practices Harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation persist. Globally, one in five young women is married before age 18. The prevalence of child marriage highlights the need for attitudinal shifts and the promotion of legal frameworks that safeguard women and girls’ rights. 6. Inadequate access to education and health care An estimated 110 million girls and young women may remain out of school by 2030. Stalled progress in reducing maternal mortality and expanding educational opportunities call for targeted interventions to meet the 2030 goals. 7. Food insecurity Nearly 24 per cent of women and girls are expected to experience moderate to severe food insecurity by 2030. Empowering women in food and agricultural systems by enhancing access to land and resources is vital for ensuring food security and economic growth. 8. Violence against women and girls Each year, 245 million women and girls experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Older women also face higher rates of poverty and violence than older men. 9. Inadequate funding for gender equality initiatives Only 4 per cent of total bilateral aid is allocated to gender equality and women\'s empowerment. The additional investment needed for achieving gender equality by 2030 is estimated at USD 360 billion per year. 10. Legal barriers and poorly enforced legislation At least 28 countries do not have laws granting women equal rights to enter marriage and initiate divorce, and 67 countries lack laws prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination against women. Where legislation does exist to promote gender equality, effective implementation remains a challenge. 11. Lack of access to clean energy and sanitation An estimated 341 million women and girls are projected to lack electricity by 2030. Universal access could significantly reduce poverty and improve women’s health. With just seven years remaining to achieve the 2030 targets, concerted efforts and funding are more necessary than ever. Each step forward, no matter how incremental, brings us closer to a future where gender equality is not just a goal, but a reality."}, {\'title\': \'Gender equality will take 300 years to achieve, UN chief warns\', \'url\': \'https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/world/un-gender-equality-300-years-intl-hnk/index.html\', \'content\': \'CNN — Progress toward gender equality is “vanishing before our eyes,” United Nations Secretary General António Guterres told the Commission on the Status of Women on Monday. Speaking to the key UN women’s rights group ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8, Guterres said gender equality is “300 years away” according to the latest estimates from UN Women, the UN organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. Guterres cited high rates of maternal mortality, girls being forced into early marriage, and girls being kidnapped and assaulted for attending school as evidence that hope of achieving gender equality “is growing more distant.” In his speech, Guterres did not mention Iran, which was expelled from the 45-member commission in December over protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s so-called “morality police.” “Women’s rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world,” Guterres said, naming a few countries in particular, including Afghanistan, where he said “women and girls have been erased from public life.” On Monday, young Afghan women gathered outside Kabul University to protest the ruling Taliban’s ban on female education, a restriction which a new UN report says may amount to “a crime against humanity.” The report presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday also noted the rise in forced and child marriages, the ban excluding women from other public spaces like parks and gyms, and other restrictions limiting women’s ability to work and travel independently in Afghanistan. Guterres said the deputy secretary-general and the executive director of UN Women recently visited Afghanistan and conveyed to the Taliban authorities that “we will never give up fighting for” women and girls. “Crisis and conflict affect women and girls first and worst,” Guterres said, including the war in Ukraine as an example. Last year, the UN called for an investigation into reports of rape and sexual violence against Ukrainian women and children following Russia’s invasion. Guterres also said that “in many places, women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back,” though he didn’t specify where. Last June, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to abortion up to individual states. The year before, a ban on abortions due to fetal defects took effect in Poland – essentially ending almost all abortions in the country. To achieve gender equality, Guterres called for “collective” and “urgent” action, from increasing education, income and employment for women and girls, especially in developing nations in the Global South, to promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology. “Centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and harmful stereotypes have created a huge gender gap in science and technology,” Guterres said. “Let’s be clear: global frameworks are not working for the world’s women and girls. They need to change.”\'}, {\'title\': \'Gender inequality in the United States - statistics & facts\', \'url\': \'https://www.statista.com/topics/11801/gender-inequality-in-the-united-states/\', \'content\': \'Gender inequalities exist around the world, including in the United States. Although women make up of the U.S. population, they remain minorities within the most elite sectors of society; as of 2023, women constituted of the House of Representatives, the Senate, Fortune 500 CEOs, and governors nationwide. Yet, any female presence in such positions of power demonstrates progress towards the advancement of women’s rights compared to a century ago. Traditionally, American women were excluded from paid work and politics, their capabilities believed to be limited to childcare and housekeeping, while men were seen as the ideal workers without such distractions. Despite subsequent expansion of surrounding gender roles still devalue women’s work to this day. In comparison to men, women in the U.S. . Simultaneously, even though women surpass men on , and even if a woman has a higher degree than a man, it is still likely that the man will Is the future of politics female? According to the 2023 Global Gender Gap report, the United States ranked only 43rd out of 146 countries examined for gender equality by the World Economic Forum, trailing behind neighboring countries Canada and Mexico, who came in 30th and 33rd respectively. The report outlined how the U.S. lost points due to declines in women’s life expectancy and in the amount of women in senior and ministerial positions, although the share of parliamentary positions held by women has increased overall. While high political offices remain dominated by men, more women can now be found in Congress , the House of Representatives and the Senate than ever before. Moreover, despite still lacking a female head of state, Kamala Harris was appointed as the first female Vice President in 2021, suggesting positive trends for female representation in leadership positions in the future. However, a 2023 study found over half of Americans to believe that a major reason behind why there are fewer women than men in high political offices is that women have to do more to prove themselves while a further 44 percent cited that family responsibilities make it harder for women to run for office, demonstrating how lingering assumptions on female capabilities may hinder future advancement of women in American politics. In addition, the study revealed how 50 percent of Americans said that a major reason that women earn less, on average, than men, is that women are treated differently by employers and 42 percent agreed that it was because women tend to make different choices between balancing work and family, further supporting the theory that gender equality in the U.S. remains restricted by outdated gender stereotypes and expectations . A dual burden for mothers Despite having the highest GDP in the world, the United States remains the only OECD country to not offer any form of national paid leave. Even more concerningly, the United States is the only country apart from Papua New Guinea to not offer new mothers some sort of paid maternity leave , instead providing eligible employees with a modest 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for family or medical reasons. However, as women are more likely to work part-time than men, they are therefore less likely to meet eligibility requirements for unpaid leave. Additionally, research has revealed that management and professional occupations provide the most access to paid family leave for their employees, occupations which tend to be dominated by men. As a result, women may struggle to remain in the workforce if they choose to start a family, particularly as studies have shown that outsourcing childcare in the United States is generally considered unaffordable for most families. The high costs of childcare and lack of paid leave mean that many working women in the U.S. must balance work and family responsibilities without assistance, a dual burden which is especially exacerbated for low-income families and single mothers. According to the literature, mothers in the U.S. are often forced to work in low-wage occupations with certain incentives, such as flexible hours, part-time work, and supplied childcare, all of which are rare among higher wage careers. Consequently, single mothers, lacking dual income, tend to be at greater risk of experiencing poverty; comparison of the overall U.S. poverty rate with that of the poverty rate for families who only have a female head of household reveals that poverty is much more prevalent in the latter. As children in the United States are significantly more likely to live with a single mother than a single father , further attention should be given to ensuring that women in such situations can provide for their families and so that mothers nationwide can participate wholly in society, regardless of their assigned gender.

In the United States and around the world, women continue to be underrepresented in high-level, highly paid positions and overrepresented in low-paying jobs. Women of color and transgender individuals experience particularly high levels of poverty, unemployment, and other economic hardships. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace contribute significantly to these persistent economic divides. Gender Income Gaps As of June 2023, the CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations included 52 women – just 10.4 percent of an elite group that earned $16.7 million on average in 2022 . By contrast, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 67.9 percent of workers earning the federal minimum wage, a rate stuck at $7.25 since 2009. Men particularly dominate highly lucrative financial industry jobs. According to Institute for Policy Studies analysis , the share of the five largest U.S. investment banks’ senior executives and top managers who are male: JPMorgan Chase: 71 percent , Goldman Sachs: 77 percent , Bank of America: 63 percent , Morgan Stanley: 76 percent , and Citigroup: 62 percent . Nationwide, men make up 62 percent of all securities industry employees but just a tiny fraction of workers who provide care services that are in high demand but continue to be very low paid. Men make up less than 6 percent of childcare workers, an occupation that pays $26,680 per year , on average. Men make up just 13 percent of home health aides, who average $29,260 per year. The gender gaps at the top of corporate hierarchies are a global phenomenon. According to World Economic Forum analysis of LinkedIn data, women worldwide continue to be outnumbered by men in senior leadership positions across all industries. Overall, women made up just 32.2 percent of senior leadership positions in 2022, nearly 10 percentage points lower than women’s total workforce representation of 41.9 percent. Men make up an overwhelming majority of top earners across the U.S. economy, even though women now represent almost half of the country’s workforce. Women comprise just 27 percent of the top 10 percent, and their share of higher income groups runs even smaller. Among the top 1 percent, women make up slightly less than 17 percent of workers, while at the top 0.1 percent level, they make up only 11 percent, according to a research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research . Other major economies show similar trend lines. A study of eight high-income countries from the London School of Economics found that women made up just 14 percent to 22 percent of the top 1 percent of earners. These surveys were conducted during the 2010-2014 period. The U.S. figure for 2012 is from the National Bureau of Economic Research . Throughout the U.S. workforce, women remain vastly underpaid. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Data finds that among full-time workers, women earned an average of 83 cents for every dollar a man earned in 2021, up from 76 cents in 2001. The narrowing of the pay gap has slowed in the past two decades compared to earlier decades when women were joining the workforce in large numbers. If part-time workers were included in these calculations, the gap would be even wider, since women are more likely to work reduced schedules, often in order to manage childbearing and other caregiving work. Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. American women earn less than men in all industries. The largest pay gaps are in financial and insurance positions, where median earnings for men stood at $103,707 in 2022, compared to just $62,214 for women. The smallest gap appears in the construction sector, but women make up only 10.8 percent of workers in this industry. The U.S. gender pay gap, while unacceptably large, is not the world’s widest. But accurately measuring these gaps across countries can be difficult. Within the OECD group of higher-income nations, South Korea holds the widest gap, with men earning 37 percent more than women, on average. The country with the narrowest gap: Luxembourg, where men make just 3.4 percent more than women. Gaps have been smallest in OECD countries where the share of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements hits at least 80 percent and widest in countries with weak collective bargaining and no or very low minimum wages. The International Labor Organization concedes that more work needs to be done to develop more accurate global gender gap analyses. One factor skewing the numbers: Women do considerably more unpaid work, from housekeeping to caring for children and the elderly. Among the 21 countries reporting data for at least one year during the 2013-2015 period, the West Bank and Gaza had the greatest imbalance, with men devoting just 16 percent as much time to unpaid domestic and caregiving work as women. Belgium, where men spend 63 percent as much time on these activities as women, ranked at the top. Since 2017, the UK government has required corporations with more than 250 employees to disclose the pay gaps between the men and women on their payrolls. Large financial firms have among the widest divides because of the scarcity of women in top positions. In 2022, Goldman Sachs International reported the biggest gap in this sector, with women making just 48.7 cents on average for every $1 earned by men at the bank. Gender Wealth Gaps Most inequality analysis focuses on income (the wages earned from a job or from capital gains) rather than wealth (the sum of one’s assets minus debts). Income inequality, while stark, pales in comparison to wealth inequality. The divides become even more dramatic when viewed through a gender lens. At the top end, we have no more striking sign of increasing global wealth concentration than the rise of the billionaire class . The number of individuals with fortunes worth at least $1 billion has more than doubled since 2010 , while remaining overwhelmingly male. As of March 1, 2023, only 298 women ranked among the world’s 2,489 billionaires, accounting for less than 12 percent. Ninety-one of them hail from the United States, nearly double the number in any other country. The retirement gap is a key factor in our country’s gender inequality. According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies , American women in late 2022 held $44,000 in median retirement savings, compared to $91,000 for men. The gender pay gap contributes to these disparities, since both pension plan and Social Security payouts are partially based on past earnings. In December 2022, women’s average annual Social Security benefit of $19,656 lagged the benefit for men by $4,584. Women’s smaller retirement nest eggs also have to stretch further because women have longer life expectancies. Debt also significantly impacts wealth. Crushing student loan debts drag many young Americans far into the negative side of the wealth line, with women bearing the heaviest burdens. Women comprise 56 percent of college students, but hold nearly two-thirds of outstanding student loan debt, according to the American Association of University Women . Black, Hispanic, and white women are more likely to have student debt than men in their racial or ethnic group. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, Black women are most likely to be shouldering this financial burden. More than 43 percent of this group have student loan debt, compared to less than 16 percent of white men. Gender Poverty Gaps The gender poverty gap has not improved significantly over the past half decade. In 1966, 12.1 percent of women and 8.4 percent of men aged 18-64 lived below the official poverty line. In 2023, 11.2 percent of women in this age group were living in poverty, compared to 8.8 percent of men. In 2023, the poverty threshold for a single person was $14,580 in annual income. Households led by single women with children faced poverty rates of 21.8 percent that year, nearly double the 11.4 percent poverty rate for households led by single men with children, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . Poverty is a particularly acute problem for women of color. In 2023, Native American women had the highest official poverty rate, at 20.4 percent – three times the 6.8 percent poverty rate for white American men. Black women had the second-highest poverty rate, at 16.8 percent, according to the National Women’s Law Center . Transgender Economic Gaps According to a KFF/Washington Post Trans Survey , a larger share of trans adults report being unemployed (14 percent vs. 8 percent) compared to cisgender (non-trans) adults. These findings reflect the significant barriers trans individuals already face in employment access and opportunity. In the National Center for Transgender Equality’s 2022 U.S Trans Survey , more than one in ten (11 percent) of respondents who had ever held a job said they had been fired, forced to resign, or laid off because of their gender identity or expression. People in the LGBTQ+ community tend to earn significantly less than the typical U.S. worker. Transgender women experience the largest gap, earning only 60 cents for every dollar earned by the typical U.S. worker, according to Human Rights Campaign analysis . Trans men earn just 70 percent of U.S. median pay. This analysis focuses only on full-time workers, meaning the wage gap for transgender individuals may be even larger, since they are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. Transgender individuals also experience exceptionally high poverty rates. The Williams Institute at the UCLA Law School analyzed results from CDC surveys conducted between 2014 and 2017. They found that the overall poverty rate among trans people stood at 29.4 percent — nearly twice the 15.7 percent poverty rate among cisgender straight people. Racial and gender disparities further exacerbate the disparities. The Williams Institute found that 38.5 percent of Black transgender and 48.4 percent of Latinx transgender adults were experiencing poverty. White cis-straight men had by far the lowest poverty rate, at just 7.6 percent. Inequality and Reproductive Rights The impact of the Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade will be most severe for low-income people in states with long histories of restricting abortions. As shown by Economic Policy Institute research , many of the states with either trigger laws (which automatically banned abortion upon Roe’s overturn) or pre-Roe abortion bans or restrictions are also states that have not raised their state minimum wage above the federal floor or have rejected federal support to allow Medicaid expansion. Eight states – Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi – have both rejected Medicaid expansion and have a $7.25 minimum wage. Inequality Across Gender Diversity and Covid-19 The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-standing gender inequalities. Women are more likely than men to work in service occupations, including domestic work, restaurant service, retail, tourism, and hospitality, that require face-to-face interactions and have been hard-hit by layoffs. Because of the nature of these jobs, teleworking is not an option for many women. Frontline jobs, which are the ones most often deemed “essential” and require people to work in-person, are also heavily staffed by women. The health care, social work, and government and community-based services occupations are overwhelmingly made up of women, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute . Women make up 73 percent of government and community-based services workers, 76 percent of health care workers, and 78 percent of social workers. The official U.S. unemployment rate does not include people who have not looked for work in the past four weeks. Because women tend to bear more responsibility for family caregiving, women with children were more likely than men to drop out of the labor force when schools and care centers closed due to Covid. Rand Corporation research reveals that the steepest decline in labor force participation in the first phase of the pandemic was among women with two children, at 3.82 points, compared to a 1.39 point drop for men with two children. More recently, the shortage of affordable childcare services has emerged as a barrier for women in returning to jobs in restaurants and other low-wage sectors, contributing to staffing challenges. Among U.S. women who’ve stopped looking for work during the pandemic, the steepest drops have been among women of color. Between February 2020 and November 2021, Black women had a 3.5 percentage point drop in labor force participation and Latinx women had a 2.8 point drop, compared to 1.7 for white women. Several factors may have contributed to women of color becoming discouraged from seeking work. On top of gender inequities, women of color face racial discrimination in hiring and layoffs and they are disproportionately concentrated in service and care sector jobs with high risks of Covid exposure. Transgender people are always in a precarious position, but the Covid-19 pandemic has made them particularly vulnerable. According to research from the Williams Institute at UCLA , transgender Americans are at a higher risk for Covid-19 for several reasons. They are more likely to be low-income, with 47.7 percent of transgender people living below 200 percent of the official U.S. poverty line, compared to 28.9 percent of the general U.S. population. They are also significantly more likely to suffer from asthma and HIV, conditions that put people at higher risk of mortality if they contract Covid-19. And they experience high barriers to receiving health care. The pandemic has also hit transgender Americans especially hard economically. A poll from the Human Rights Campaign and PSB Research shows that as of June 2020, 54 percent of transgender people had experienced reduced work hours — more than double the 23 percent of the total U.S. workforce that faced a similar reduction. Twenty-seven percent of transgender people had experienced pay cuts, compared to just 7 percent of the U.S. workforce. And 19 percent had become unemployed due to the pandemic, a significantly larger share than the general population.\'}, {\'title\': "Women\'s rights are under attack 30 years after leaders adopted a ...", \'url\': \'https://apnews.com/article/un-women-girls-equality-beijing-conference-rights-b009715ff605ccf47f1b72865c7a27e7\', \'content\': \'UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Thirty years after world leaders adopted a historic blueprint to achieve gender equality, a new United Nations report says women’s and girls’ rights are under attack and gender discrimination remains deeply embedded in economies and societies. The report released Thursday by the U.N. agency focused on women’s rights and gender equality found that nearly one-quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash to women’s rights last year. The number of countries reporting a backlash is likely underreported and reflects “an increasingly hostile environment,” UN Women’s policy and program director Sarah Hendriks said at a news conference. “It is not a new phenomenon,” she said. “What is new is that it’s gaining in greater speed and scale and velocity,” especially in very patriarchal and traditional nations where men play a dominant role. The 35 countries reporting a backlash on gender equality came from across the globe and include Spain, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia, Australia, Mongolia, South Africa, Mali and Zimbabwe. Despite some progress, including on girls’ education and access to family planning, UN Women said a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a partner or family member and that cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased by 50% since 2022. The report, released ahead of International Women’s Day on Saturday, also noted that only 87 countries have ever been led by a woman. “Globally, women’s human rights are under attack,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “Instead of mainstreaming equal rights, we’re seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny.” He said the world must stand firm “in making human rights, equality and empowerment a reality for all women and girls, for everyone, everywhere.” The 189 countries that attended a 1995 Beijing women’s conference adopted a landmark declaration and 150-page platform for action to achieve gender equality, calling for bold action in 12 areas, including combating poverty and gender-based violence and putting women at top levels in business, government and at peacemaking tables. It also said for the first time in a U.N. document that human rights include the right of women to control and decide “on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.” In the new review, which includes contributions from 159 countries, UN Women said countries have taken many steps forward on gender equality and women’s rights in the past five years but that such rights still are facing growing threats worldwide. On the positive side , the report said some 88% of countries have passed laws to combat violence against women and established services to help victims in the past five years. Most countries have banned workplace discrimination, and 44% are improving the quality of education and training for girls and women, it said. Yet gender discrimination is deeply embedded, with wide gaps in power and resources that restrain women’s rights, the report said. “The weakening of democratic institutions has gone hand in hand with backlash on gender equality,” UN Women said. It warned that “anti-rights actors are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues” and seeking to block or slow legal and policy gains they can’t roll back. UN Women said almost 25% of countries reported that backlash on gender equality is hampering implementation of the Beijing platform. According to the report, women have only 64% of the legal rights of men, and while the proportion of female lawmakers has more than doubled since 1995, three-quarters of lawmakers are still men. UN Women also said women aged 15 to 24 lag behind other age groups on access to modern family planning; maternal mortality ratios have remained almost unchanged since 2015; and 10% of women and girls live in extremely poor households. The U.N. agency said cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased 50% since 2022 — and women and girls are victims of 95% of these crimes. UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said that based on the report’s findings, the agency has adopted a roadmap to bring the world closer to the U.N. goal of achieving gender equality by 2030. It calls for a digital revolution ensuring equal access to technology for all women and girls; investments in social protections, including universal health care and quality education to lift them out of poverty; and zero violence against girls and women. The roadmap also includes equal decision-making power for women and financing for “gender-responsive humanitarian aid” in conflicts and crises. ___ Lederer was AP’s lead reporter at the 1995 U.N. women’s conference in Beijing.\'}]\n</retrieved data>'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

But it doesn’t need to. A new global analysis of progress on gender equality and women’s rights shows women and girls remain disproportionately affected by the socioeconomic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, struggling with disproportionately high job and livelihood losses, education disruptions and increased burdens of unpaid care work. Women’s health services, poorly funded even before the pandemic, faced major disruptions, undermining women’s sexual and reproductive health. And despite women’s central role in responding to COVID-19, including as front-line health workers, they are still largely bypassed for leadership positions they deserve. VIDEO UN Women’s latest report, together with UN DESA, Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2021 presents the latest data on gender equality across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The report highlights the progress made since 2015 but also the continued alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic, its immediate effect on women’s well-being and the threat it poses to future generations. We’re breaking down some of the findings from the report, and calling for the action needed to accelerate progress. The pandemic is making matters worse One and a half years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the toll on the poorest and most vulnerable people remains devastating and disproportionate. The combined impact of conflict, extreme weather events and COVID-19 has deprived women and girls of even basic needs such as food security. Without urgent action to stem rising poverty, hunger and inequality, especially in countries affected by conflict and other acute forms of crisis, millions will continue to suffer. A global goal by global goal reality check: Goal 1. Poverty In 2021, extreme poverty is on the rise and progress towards its elimination has reversed. An estimated 435 million women and girls globally are living in extreme poverty. And yet we can change this . Over 150 million women and girls could emerge from poverty by 2030 if governments implement a comprehensive strategy to improve access to education and family planning, achieve equal wages and extend social transfers. Goal 2. Zero hunger The global gender gap in food security has risen dramatically during the pandemic, with more women and girls going hungry. Women’s food insecurity levels were 10 per cent higher than men’s in 2020, compared with 6 per cent higher in 2019. This trend can be reversed , including by supporting women small-scale producers, who typically earn far less than men, through increased funding, training and land rights reforms. Goal 3. Good health and well-being Disruptions in essential health services due to COVID-19 are taking a tragic toll on women and girls. In the first year of the pandemic, there were an estimated 1.4 million additional unintended pregnancies in lower and middle-income countries. We need to do better . Response to the pandemic must include prioritizing sexual and reproductive health services, ensuring they continue to operate safely now and after the pandemic is long over. In addition, more support is needed to ensure life-saving personal protection equipment, tests, oxygen and especially vaccines are available in rich and poor countries alike as well as to vulnerable population within countries. Goal 4. Quality education A year and a half into the pandemic, schools remain partially or fully closed in 42 per cent of the world’s countries and territories. School closures spell lost opportunities for girls and an increased risk of violence, exploitation and early marriage . Governments can do more to protect girls education . Measures focused specifically on supporting girls returning to school are urgently needed, including measures focused on girls from marginalized communities who are most at risk. Goal 5. Gender equality The pandemic has tested and even reversed progress in expanding women’s rights and opportunities. Reports of violence against women and girls, a “shadow” pandemic to COVID-19, are increasing in many parts of the world. COVID-19 is also intensifying women’s workload at home, forcing many to leave the labour force altogether. And yet we can change this . Building forward differently and better will hinge on placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting. Goal 6. Clean water and sanitation In 2018, nearly 2.3 billion people lived in water-stressed countries. Without safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and menstrual hygiene facilities, women and girls find it harder to lead safe, productive and healthy lives. Change is possible . Involve those most impacted in water management processes, including women. Women’s voices are often missing in water management processes. Goal 7. Affordable and clean energy Increased demand for clean energy and low-carbon solutions is driving an unprecedented transformation of the energy sector. But women are being left out. Women hold only 32 per cent of renewable energy jobs. We can do better . Expose girls early on to STEM education, provide training and support to women entering the energy field, close the pay gap and increase women’s leadership in the energy sector. Goal 8. Decent work and economic growth The number of employed women declined by 54 million in 2020 and 45 million women left the labour market altogether. Women have suffered steeper job losses than men, along with increased unpaid care burdens at home. We must do more to support women in the workforce . Guarantee decent work for all, introduce labour laws/reforms, removing legal barriers for married women entering the workforce, support access to affordable/quality childcare. Goal 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure The COVID-19 crisis has spurred striking achievements in medical research and innovation. Women’s contribution has been profound. But still only a little over a third of graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field are female. We can take action today. Quotas mandating that a proportion of research grants are awarded to women-led teams or teams that include women is one concrete way to support women researchers. Goal 10. Reduced inequalities Limited progress for women is being eroded by the pandemic. Women facing multiple forms of discrimination, including women and girls with disabilities, migrant women, women discriminated against because of their race/ethnicity are especially affected. We need to do better . Commit to end racism and discrimination in all its forms, invest in inclusive, universal, gender responsive social protection systems that support all women. Goal 11. Sustainable cities and communities Globally, more than 1 billion people live in informal settlements and slums. Women and girls, often overrepresented in these densely populated areas, suffer from lack of access to basic water and sanitation, health care and transportation. The needs of urban poor women must be prioritized . Increase the provision of durable and adequate housing and equitable access to land; included women in urban planning and development processes. Goal 12. Sustainable consumption and production; Goal 13. Climate action; Goal 14. Life below water; and Goal 15. Life on land Women activists, scientists and researchers are working hard to solve the climate crisis but often without the same platforms as men to share their knowledge and skills. Only 29 per cent of featured speakers at international ocean science conferences are women. And yet we can change this . Ensure women activists, scientists and researchers have equal voice, representation and access to forums where these issues are being discussed and debated. Goal 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions The lack of women in decision-making limits the reach and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergency recovery efforts. In conflict-affected countries, 18.9 per cent of parliamentary seats are held by women, much lower than the global average of 25.6 per cent. This is unacceptable . It\'s time for women to have an equal share of power and decision-making at all levels. Goal 17. Global partnerships for the goals There are just 9 years left to achieve the Global Goals by 2030, and gender equality cuts across all 17 of them. With COVID-19 slowing progress on women\'s rights, the time to act is now. Looking ahead As it stands today, only one indicator under the global goal for gender equality (SDG5) is ‘close to target’: proportion of seats held by women in local government. In other areas critical to women’s empowerment, equality in time spent on unpaid care and domestic work and decision making regarding sexual and reproductive health the world is far from target. Without a bold commitment to accelerate progress, the global community will fail to achieve gender equality. Building forward differently and better will require placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting."}, {\'title\': "The 11 biggest hurdles for women\'s equality by 2030", \'url\': \'https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/feature-story/2023/09/the-11-biggest-hurdles-for-womens-equality-by-2030\', \'content\': "1. Lack of women in leadership With just 27 per cent of parliamentary seats, 36 per cent of local government seats, and 28 per cent of management positions held by women, there is a lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making processes, hindering comprehensive policy formulation. 2. Poverty and lack of economic opportunities More than 340 million women and girls are projected to live in extreme poverty by 2030. This represents a staggering 8 per cent of the global female population surviving on less than USD 2.15 a day. Social protections, access to decent work, and other support systems are urgently needed to provide a path out of poverty. 3. Workplace discrimination and inequalities Only 61 per cent of prime working-age women participate in the labour force, compared to 91 per cent of prime working-age men. This affects both economic growth and societal progress. In 2019, for each dollar men earned in labour income, women earned only 51 cents. 4. An imbalance in unpaid care work On the current trajectory, the gap between the time spent by women and men on unpaid care will narrow slightly, but by 2050, women globally will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time (2.3 more hours per day) on unpaid care work than men. This persistent gap limits women’s participation in education, employment, and other opportunities. 5. Social norms and cultural practices Harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation persist. Globally, one in five young women is married before age 18. The prevalence of child marriage highlights the need for attitudinal shifts and the promotion of legal frameworks that safeguard women and girls’ rights. 6. Inadequate access to education and health care An estimated 110 million girls and young women may remain out of school by 2030. Stalled progress in reducing maternal mortality and expanding educational opportunities call for targeted interventions to meet the 2030 goals. 7. Food insecurity Nearly 24 per cent of women and girls are expected to experience moderate to severe food insecurity by 2030. Empowering women in food and agricultural systems by enhancing access to land and resources is vital for ensuring food security and economic growth. 8. Violence against women and girls Each year, 245 million women and girls experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Older women also face higher rates of poverty and violence than older men. 9. Inadequate funding for gender equality initiatives Only 4 per cent of total bilateral aid is allocated to gender equality and women\'s empowerment. The additional investment needed for achieving gender equality by 2030 is estimated at USD 360 billion per year. 10. Legal barriers and poorly enforced legislation At least 28 countries do not have laws granting women equal rights to enter marriage and initiate divorce, and 67 countries lack laws prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination against women. Where legislation does exist to promote gender equality, effective implementation remains a challenge. 11. Lack of access to clean energy and sanitation An estimated 341 million women and girls are projected to lack electricity by 2030. Universal access could significantly reduce poverty and improve women’s health. With just seven years remaining to achieve the 2030 targets, concerted efforts and funding are more necessary than ever. Each step forward, no matter how incremental, brings us closer to a future where gender equality is not just a goal, but a reality."}, {\'title\': \'Gender equality will take 300 years to achieve, UN chief warns\', \'url\': \'https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/world/un-gender-equality-300-years-intl-hnk/index.html\', \'content\': \'CNN — Progress toward gender equality is “vanishing before our eyes,” United Nations Secretary General António Guterres told the Commission on the Status of Women on Monday. Speaking to the key UN women’s rights group ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8, Guterres said gender equality is “300 years away” according to the latest estimates from UN Women, the UN organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. Guterres cited high rates of maternal mortality, girls being forced into early marriage, and girls being kidnapped and assaulted for attending school as evidence that hope of achieving gender equality “is growing more distant.” In his speech, Guterres did not mention Iran, which was expelled from the 45-member commission in December over protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s so-called “morality police.” “Women’s rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world,” Guterres said, naming a few countries in particular, including Afghanistan, where he said “women and girls have been erased from public life.” On Monday, young Afghan women gathered outside Kabul University to protest the ruling Taliban’s ban on female education, a restriction which a new UN report says may amount to “a crime against humanity.” The report presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday also noted the rise in forced and child marriages, the ban excluding women from other public spaces like parks and gyms, and other restrictions limiting women’s ability to work and travel independently in Afghanistan. Guterres said the deputy secretary-general and the executive director of UN Women recently visited Afghanistan and conveyed to the Taliban authorities that “we will never give up fighting for” women and girls. “Crisis and conflict affect women and girls first and worst,” Guterres said, including the war in Ukraine as an example. Last year, the UN called for an investigation into reports of rape and sexual violence against Ukrainian women and children following Russia’s invasion. Guterres also said that “in many places, women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back,” though he didn’t specify where. Last June, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to abortion up to individual states. The year before, a ban on abortions due to fetal defects took effect in Poland – essentially ending almost all abortions in the country. To achieve gender equality, Guterres called for “collective” and “urgent” action, from increasing education, income and employment for women and girls, especially in developing nations in the Global South, to promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology. “Centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and harmful stereotypes have created a huge gender gap in science and technology,” Guterres said. “Let’s be clear: global frameworks are not working for the world’s women and girls. They need to change.”\'}, {\'title\': \'Gender inequality in the United States - statistics & facts\', \'url\': \'https://www.statista.com/topics/11801/gender-inequality-in-the-united-states/\', \'content\': \'Gender inequalities exist around the world, including in the United States. Although women make up of the U.S. population, they remain minorities within the most elite sectors of society; as of 2023, women constituted of the House of Representatives, the Senate, Fortune 500 CEOs, and governors nationwide. Yet, any female presence in such positions of power demonstrates progress towards the advancement of women’s rights compared to a century ago. Traditionally, American women were excluded from paid work and politics, their capabilities believed to be limited to childcare and housekeeping, while men were seen as the ideal workers without such distractions. Despite subsequent expansion of surrounding gender roles still devalue women’s work to this day. In comparison to men, women in the U.S. . Simultaneously, even though women surpass men on , and even if a woman has a higher degree than a man, it is still likely that the man will Is the future of politics female? According to the 2023 Global Gender Gap report, the United States ranked only 43rd out of 146 countries examined for gender equality by the World Economic Forum, trailing behind neighboring countries Canada and Mexico, who came in 30th and 33rd respectively. The report outlined how the U.S. lost points due to declines in women’s life expectancy and in the amount of women in senior and ministerial positions, although the share of parliamentary positions held by women has increased overall. While high political offices remain dominated by men, more women can now be found in Congress , the House of Representatives and the Senate than ever before. Moreover, despite still lacking a female head of state, Kamala Harris was appointed as the first female Vice President in 2021, suggesting positive trends for female representation in leadership positions in the future. However, a 2023 study found over half of Americans to believe that a major reason behind why there are fewer women than men in high political offices is that women have to do more to prove themselves while a further 44 percent cited that family responsibilities make it harder for women to run for office, demonstrating how lingering assumptions on female capabilities may hinder future advancement of women in American politics. In addition, the study revealed how 50 percent of Americans said that a major reason that women earn less, on average, than men, is that women are treated differently by employers and 42 percent agreed that it was because women tend to make different choices between balancing work and family, further supporting the theory that gender equality in the U.S. remains restricted by outdated gender stereotypes and expectations . A dual burden for mothers Despite having the highest GDP in the world, the United States remains the only OECD country to not offer any form of national paid leave. Even more concerningly, the United States is the only country apart from Papua New Guinea to not offer new mothers some sort of paid maternity leave , instead providing eligible employees with a modest 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for family or medical reasons. However, as women are more likely to work part-time than men, they are therefore less likely to meet eligibility requirements for unpaid leave. Additionally, research has revealed that management and professional occupations provide the most access to paid family leave for their employees, occupations which tend to be dominated by men. As a result, women may struggle to remain in the workforce if they choose to start a family, particularly as studies have shown that outsourcing childcare in the United States is generally considered unaffordable for most families. The high costs of childcare and lack of paid leave mean that many working women in the U.S. must balance work and family responsibilities without assistance, a dual burden which is especially exacerbated for low-income families and single mothers. According to the literature, mothers in the U.S. are often forced to work in low-wage occupations with certain incentives, such as flexible hours, part-time work, and supplied childcare, all of which are rare among higher wage careers. Consequently, single mothers, lacking dual income, tend to be at greater risk of experiencing poverty; comparison of the overall U.S. poverty rate with that of the poverty rate for families who only have a female head of household reveals that poverty is much more prevalent in the latter. As children in the United States are significantly more likely to live with a single mother than a single father , further attention should be given to ensuring that women in such situations can provide for their families and so that mothers nationwide can participate wholly in society, regardless of their assigned gender.

In the United States and around the world, women continue to be underrepresented in high-level, highly paid positions and overrepresented in low-paying jobs. Women of color and transgender individuals experience particularly high levels of poverty, unemployment, and other economic hardships. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace contribute significantly to these persistent economic divides. Gender Income Gaps As of June 2023, the CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations included 52 women – just 10.4 percent of an elite group that earned $16.7 million on average in 2022 . By contrast, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 67.9 percent of workers earning the federal minimum wage, a rate stuck at $7.25 since 2009. Men particularly dominate highly lucrative financial industry jobs. According to Institute for Policy Studies analysis , the share of the five largest U.S. investment banks’ senior executives and top managers who are male: JPMorgan Chase: 71 percent , Goldman Sachs: 77 percent , Bank of America: 63 percent , Morgan Stanley: 76 percent , and Citigroup: 62 percent . Nationwide, men make up 62 percent of all securities industry employees but just a tiny fraction of workers who provide care services that are in high demand but continue to be very low paid. Men make up less than 6 percent of childcare workers, an occupation that pays $26,680 per year , on average. Men make up just 13 percent of home health aides, who average $29,260 per year. The gender gaps at the top of corporate hierarchies are a global phenomenon. According to World Economic Forum analysis of LinkedIn data, women worldwide continue to be outnumbered by men in senior leadership positions across all industries. Overall, women made up just 32.2 percent of senior leadership positions in 2022, nearly 10 percentage points lower than women’s total workforce representation of 41.9 percent. Men make up an overwhelming majority of top earners across the U.S. economy, even though women now represent almost half of the country’s workforce. Women comprise just 27 percent of the top 10 percent, and their share of higher income groups runs even smaller. Among the top 1 percent, women make up slightly less than 17 percent of workers, while at the top 0.1 percent level, they make up only 11 percent, according to a research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research . Other major economies show similar trend lines. A study of eight high-income countries from the London School of Economics found that women made up just 14 percent to 22 percent of the top 1 percent of earners. These surveys were conducted during the 2010-2014 period. The U.S. figure for 2012 is from the National Bureau of Economic Research . Throughout the U.S. workforce, women remain vastly underpaid. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Data finds that among full-time workers, women earned an average of 83 cents for every dollar a man earned in 2021, up from 76 cents in 2001. The narrowing of the pay gap has slowed in the past two decades compared to earlier decades when women were joining the workforce in large numbers. If part-time workers were included in these calculations, the gap would be even wider, since women are more likely to work reduced schedules, often in order to manage childbearing and other caregiving work. Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. American women earn less than men in all industries. The largest pay gaps are in financial and insurance positions, where median earnings for men stood at $103,707 in 2022, compared to just $62,214 for women. The smallest gap appears in the construction sector, but women make up only 10.8 percent of workers in this industry. The U.S. gender pay gap, while unacceptably large, is not the world’s widest. But accurately measuring these gaps across countries can be difficult. Within the OECD group of higher-income nations, South Korea holds the widest gap, with men earning 37 percent more than women, on average. The country with the narrowest gap: Luxembourg, where men make just 3.4 percent more than women. Gaps have been smallest in OECD countries where the share of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements hits at least 80 percent and widest in countries with weak collective bargaining and no or very low minimum wages. The International Labor Organization concedes that more work needs to be done to develop more accurate global gender gap analyses. One factor skewing the numbers: Women do considerably more unpaid work, from housekeeping to caring for children and the elderly. Among the 21 countries reporting data for at least one year during the 2013-2015 period, the West Bank and Gaza had the greatest imbalance, with men devoting just 16 percent as much time to unpaid domestic and caregiving work as women. Belgium, where men spend 63 percent as much time on these activities as women, ranked at the top. Since 2017, the UK government has required corporations with more than 250 employees to disclose the pay gaps between the men and women on their payrolls. Large financial firms have among the widest divides because of the scarcity of women in top positions. In 2022, Goldman Sachs International reported the biggest gap in this sector, with women making just 48.7 cents on average for every $1 earned by men at the bank. Gender Wealth Gaps Most inequality analysis focuses on income (the wages earned from a job or from capital gains) rather than wealth (the sum of one’s assets minus debts). Income inequality, while stark, pales in comparison to wealth inequality. The divides become even more dramatic when viewed through a gender lens. At the top end, we have no more striking sign of increasing global wealth concentration than the rise of the billionaire class . The number of individuals with fortunes worth at least $1 billion has more than doubled since 2010 , while remaining overwhelmingly male. As of March 1, 2023, only 298 women ranked among the world’s 2,489 billionaires, accounting for less than 12 percent. Ninety-one of them hail from the United States, nearly double the number in any other country. The retirement gap is a key factor in our country’s gender inequality. According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies , American women in late 2022 held $44,000 in median retirement savings, compared to $91,000 for men. The gender pay gap contributes to these disparities, since both pension plan and Social Security payouts are partially based on past earnings. In December 2022, women’s average annual Social Security benefit of $19,656 lagged the benefit for men by $4,584. Women’s smaller retirement nest eggs also have to stretch further because women have longer life expectancies. Debt also significantly impacts wealth. Crushing student loan debts drag many young Americans far into the negative side of the wealth line, with women bearing the heaviest burdens. Women comprise 56 percent of college students, but hold nearly two-thirds of outstanding student loan debt, according to the American Association of University Women . Black, Hispanic, and white women are more likely to have student debt than men in their racial or ethnic group. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, Black women are most likely to be shouldering this financial burden. More than 43 percent of this group have student loan debt, compared to less than 16 percent of white men. Gender Poverty Gaps The gender poverty gap has not improved significantly over the past half decade. In 1966, 12.1 percent of women and 8.4 percent of men aged 18-64 lived below the official poverty line. In 2023, 11.2 percent of women in this age group were living in poverty, compared to 8.8 percent of men. In 2023, the poverty threshold for a single person was $14,580 in annual income. Households led by single women with children faced poverty rates of 21.8 percent that year, nearly double the 11.4 percent poverty rate for households led by single men with children, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . Poverty is a particularly acute problem for women of color. In 2023, Native American women had the highest official poverty rate, at 20.4 percent – three times the 6.8 percent poverty rate for white American men. Black women had the second-highest poverty rate, at 16.8 percent, according to the National Women’s Law Center . Transgender Economic Gaps According to a KFF/Washington Post Trans Survey , a larger share of trans adults report being unemployed (14 percent vs. 8 percent) compared to cisgender (non-trans) adults. These findings reflect the significant barriers trans individuals already face in employment access and opportunity. In the National Center for Transgender Equality’s 2022 U.S Trans Survey , more than one in ten (11 percent) of respondents who had ever held a job said they had been fired, forced to resign, or laid off because of their gender identity or expression. People in the LGBTQ+ community tend to earn significantly less than the typical U.S. worker. Transgender women experience the largest gap, earning only 60 cents for every dollar earned by the typical U.S. worker, according to Human Rights Campaign analysis . Trans men earn just 70 percent of U.S. median pay. This analysis focuses only on full-time workers, meaning the wage gap for transgender individuals may be even larger, since they are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. Transgender individuals also experience exceptionally high poverty rates. The Williams Institute at the UCLA Law School analyzed results from CDC surveys conducted between 2014 and 2017. They found that the overall poverty rate among trans people stood at 29.4 percent — nearly twice the 15.7 percent poverty rate among cisgender straight people. Racial and gender disparities further exacerbate the disparities. The Williams Institute found that 38.5 percent of Black transgender and 48.4 percent of Latinx transgender adults were experiencing poverty. White cis-straight men had by far the lowest poverty rate, at just 7.6 percent. Inequality and Reproductive Rights The impact of the Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade will be most severe for low-income people in states with long histories of restricting abortions. As shown by Economic Policy Institute research , many of the states with either trigger laws (which automatically banned abortion upon Roe’s overturn) or pre-Roe abortion bans or restrictions are also states that have not raised their state minimum wage above the federal floor or have rejected federal support to allow Medicaid expansion. Eight states – Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi – have both rejected Medicaid expansion and have a $7.25 minimum wage. Inequality Across Gender Diversity and Covid-19 The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-standing gender inequalities. Women are more likely than men to work in service occupations, including domestic work, restaurant service, retail, tourism, and hospitality, that require face-to-face interactions and have been hard-hit by layoffs. Because of the nature of these jobs, teleworking is not an option for many women. Frontline jobs, which are the ones most often deemed “essential” and require people to work in-person, are also heavily staffed by women. The health care, social work, and government and community-based services occupations are overwhelmingly made up of women, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute . Women make up 73 percent of government and community-based services workers, 76 percent of health care workers, and 78 percent of social workers. The official U.S. unemployment rate does not include people who have not looked for work in the past four weeks. Because women tend to bear more responsibility for family caregiving, women with children were more likely than men to drop out of the labor force when schools and care centers closed due to Covid. Rand Corporation research reveals that the steepest decline in labor force participation in the first phase of the pandemic was among women with two children, at 3.82 points, compared to a 1.39 point drop for men with two children. More recently, the shortage of affordable childcare services has emerged as a barrier for women in returning to jobs in restaurants and other low-wage sectors, contributing to staffing challenges. Among U.S. women who’ve stopped looking for work during the pandemic, the steepest drops have been among women of color. Between February 2020 and November 2021, Black women had a 3.5 percentage point drop in labor force participation and Latinx women had a 2.8 point drop, compared to 1.7 for white women. Several factors may have contributed to women of color becoming discouraged from seeking work. On top of gender inequities, women of color face racial discrimination in hiring and layoffs and they are disproportionately concentrated in service and care sector jobs with high risks of Covid exposure. Transgender people are always in a precarious position, but the Covid-19 pandemic has made them particularly vulnerable. According to research from the Williams Institute at UCLA , transgender Americans are at a higher risk for Covid-19 for several reasons. They are more likely to be low-income, with 47.7 percent of transgender people living below 200 percent of the official U.S. poverty line, compared to 28.9 percent of the general U.S. population. They are also significantly more likely to suffer from asthma and HIV, conditions that put people at higher risk of mortality if they contract Covid-19. And they experience high barriers to receiving health care. The pandemic has also hit transgender Americans especially hard economically. A poll from the Human Rights Campaign and PSB Research shows that as of June 2020, 54 percent of transgender people had experienced reduced work hours — more than double the 23 percent of the total U.S. workforce that faced a similar reduction. Twenty-seven percent of transgender people had experienced pay cuts, compared to just 7 percent of the U.S. workforce. And 19 percent had become unemployed due to the pandemic, a significantly larger share than the general population.\'}, {\'title\': "Women\'s rights are under attack 30 years after leaders adopted a ...", \'url\': \'https://apnews.com/article/un-women-girls-equality-beijing-conference-rights-b009715ff605ccf47f1b72865c7a27e7\', \'content\': \'UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Thirty years after world leaders adopted a historic blueprint to achieve gender equality, a new United Nations report says women’s and girls’ rights are under attack and gender discrimination remains deeply embedded in economies and societies. The report released Thursday by the U.N. agency focused on women’s rights and gender equality found that nearly one-quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash to women’s rights last year. The number of countries reporting a backlash is likely underreported and reflects “an increasingly hostile environment,” UN Women’s policy and program director Sarah Hendriks said at a news conference. “It is not a new phenomenon,” she said. “What is new is that it’s gaining in greater speed and scale and velocity,” especially in very patriarchal and traditional nations where men play a dominant role. The 35 countries reporting a backlash on gender equality came from across the globe and include Spain, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia, Australia, Mongolia, South Africa, Mali and Zimbabwe. Despite some progress, including on girls’ education and access to family planning, UN Women said a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a partner or family member and that cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased by 50% since 2022. The report, released ahead of International Women’s Day on Saturday, also noted that only 87 countries have ever been led by a woman. “Globally, women’s human rights are under attack,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “Instead of mainstreaming equal rights, we’re seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny.” He said the world must stand firm “in making human rights, equality and empowerment a reality for all women and girls, for everyone, everywhere.” The 189 countries that attended a 1995 Beijing women’s conference adopted a landmark declaration and 150-page platform for action to achieve gender equality, calling for bold action in 12 areas, including combating poverty and gender-based violence and putting women at top levels in business, government and at peacemaking tables. It also said for the first time in a U.N. document that human rights include the right of women to control and decide “on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.” In the new review, which includes contributions from 159 countries, UN Women said countries have taken many steps forward on gender equality and women’s rights in the past five years but that such rights still are facing growing threats worldwide. On the positive side , the report said some 88% of countries have passed laws to combat violence against women and established services to help victims in the past five years. Most countries have banned workplace discrimination, and 44% are improving the quality of education and training for girls and women, it said. Yet gender discrimination is deeply embedded, with wide gaps in power and resources that restrain women’s rights, the report said. “The weakening of democratic institutions has gone hand in hand with backlash on gender equality,” UN Women said. It warned that “anti-rights actors are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues” and seeking to block or slow legal and policy gains they can’t roll back. UN Women said almost 25% of countries reported that backlash on gender equality is hampering implementation of the Beijing platform. According to the report, women have only 64% of the legal rights of men, and while the proportion of female lawmakers has more than doubled since 1995, three-quarters of lawmakers are still men. UN Women also said women aged 15 to 24 lag behind other age groups on access to modern family planning; maternal mortality ratios have remained almost unchanged since 2015; and 10% of women and girls live in extremely poor households. The U.N. agency said cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased 50% since 2022 — and women and girls are victims of 95% of these crimes. UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said that based on the report’s findings, the agency has adopted a roadmap to bring the world closer to the U.N. goal of achieving gender equality by 2030. It calls for a digital revolution ensuring equal access to technology for all women and girls; investments in social protections, including universal health care and quality education to lift them out of poverty; and zero violence against girls and women. The roadmap also includes equal decision-making power for women and financing for “gender-responsive humanitarian aid” in conflicts and crises. ___ Lederer was AP’s lead reporter at the 1995 U.N. women’s conference in Beijing.\'}]\n</retrieved data>'}], 'model': 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}}

But it doesn’t need to. A new global analysis of progress on gender equality and women’s rights shows women and girls remain disproportionately affected by the socioeconomic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, struggling with disproportionately high job and livelihood losses, education disruptions and increased burdens of unpaid care work. Women’s health services, poorly funded even before the pandemic, faced major disruptions, undermining women’s sexual and reproductive health. And despite women’s central role in responding to COVID-19, including as front-line health workers, they are still largely bypassed for leadership positions they deserve. VIDEO UN Women’s latest report, together with UN DESA, Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2021 presents the latest data on gender equality across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The report highlights the progress made since 2015 but also the continued alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic, its immediate effect on women’s well-being and the threat it poses to future generations. We’re breaking down some of the findings from the report, and calling for the action needed to accelerate progress. The pandemic is making matters worse One and a half years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the toll on the poorest and most vulnerable people remains devastating and disproportionate. The combined impact of conflict, extreme weather events and COVID-19 has deprived women and girls of even basic needs such as food security. Without urgent action to stem rising poverty, hunger and inequality, especially in countries affected by conflict and other acute forms of crisis, millions will continue to suffer. A global goal by global goal reality check: Goal 1. Poverty In 2021, extreme poverty is on the rise and progress towards its elimination has reversed. An estimated 435 million women and girls globally are living in extreme poverty. And yet we can change this . Over 150 million women and girls could emerge from poverty by 2030 if governments implement a comprehensive strategy to improve access to education and family planning, achieve equal wages and extend social transfers. Goal 2. Zero hunger The global gender gap in food security has risen dramatically during the pandemic, with more women and girls going hungry. Women’s food insecurity levels were 10 per cent higher than men’s in 2020, compared with 6 per cent higher in 2019. This trend can be reversed , including by supporting women small-scale producers, who typically earn far less than men, through increased funding, training and land rights reforms. Goal 3. Good health and well-being Disruptions in essential health services due to COVID-19 are taking a tragic toll on women and girls. In the first year of the pandemic, there were an estimated 1.4 million additional unintended pregnancies in lower and middle-income countries. We need to do better . Response to the pandemic must include prioritizing sexual and reproductive health services, ensuring they continue to operate safely now and after the pandemic is long over. In addition, more support is needed to ensure life-saving personal protection equipment, tests, oxygen and especially vaccines are available in rich and poor countries alike as well as to vulnerable population within countries. Goal 4. Quality education A year and a half into the pandemic, schools remain partially or fully closed in 42 per cent of the world’s countries and territories. School closures spell lost opportunities for girls and an increased risk of violence, exploitation and early marriage . Governments can do more to protect girls education . Measures focused specifically on supporting girls returning to school are urgently needed, including measures focused on girls from marginalized communities who are most at risk. Goal 5. Gender equality The pandemic has tested and even reversed progress in expanding women’s rights and opportunities. Reports of violence against women and girls, a “shadow” pandemic to COVID-19, are increasing in many parts of the world. COVID-19 is also intensifying women’s workload at home, forcing many to leave the labour force altogether. And yet we can change this . Building forward differently and better will hinge on placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting. Goal 6. Clean water and sanitation In 2018, nearly 2.3 billion people lived in water-stressed countries. Without safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and menstrual hygiene facilities, women and girls find it harder to lead safe, productive and healthy lives. Change is possible . Involve those most impacted in water management processes, including women. Women’s voices are often missing in water management processes. Goal 7. Affordable and clean energy Increased demand for clean energy and low-carbon solutions is driving an unprecedented transformation of the energy sector. But women are being left out. Women hold only 32 per cent of renewable energy jobs. We can do better . Expose girls early on to STEM education, provide training and support to women entering the energy field, close the pay gap and increase women’s leadership in the energy sector. Goal 8. Decent work and economic growth The number of employed women declined by 54 million in 2020 and 45 million women left the labour market altogether. Women have suffered steeper job losses than men, along with increased unpaid care burdens at home. We must do more to support women in the workforce . Guarantee decent work for all, introduce labour laws/reforms, removing legal barriers for married women entering the workforce, support access to affordable/quality childcare. Goal 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure The COVID-19 crisis has spurred striking achievements in medical research and innovation. Women’s contribution has been profound. But still only a little over a third of graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field are female. We can take action today. Quotas mandating that a proportion of research grants are awarded to women-led teams or teams that include women is one concrete way to support women researchers. Goal 10. Reduced inequalities Limited progress for women is being eroded by the pandemic. Women facing multiple forms of discrimination, including women and girls with disabilities, migrant women, women discriminated against because of their race/ethnicity are especially affected. We need to do better . Commit to end racism and discrimination in all its forms, invest in inclusive, universal, gender responsive social protection systems that support all women. Goal 11. Sustainable cities and communities Globally, more than 1 billion people live in informal settlements and slums. Women and girls, often overrepresented in these densely populated areas, suffer from lack of access to basic water and sanitation, health care and transportation. The needs of urban poor women must be prioritized . Increase the provision of durable and adequate housing and equitable access to land; included women in urban planning and development processes. Goal 12. Sustainable consumption and production; Goal 13. Climate action; Goal 14. Life below water; and Goal 15. Life on land Women activists, scientists and researchers are working hard to solve the climate crisis but often without the same platforms as men to share their knowledge and skills. Only 29 per cent of featured speakers at international ocean science conferences are women. And yet we can change this . Ensure women activists, scientists and researchers have equal voice, representation and access to forums where these issues are being discussed and debated. Goal 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions The lack of women in decision-making limits the reach and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergency recovery efforts. In conflict-affected countries, 18.9 per cent of parliamentary seats are held by women, much lower than the global average of 25.6 per cent. This is unacceptable . It\'s time for women to have an equal share of power and decision-making at all levels. Goal 17. Global partnerships for the goals There are just 9 years left to achieve the Global Goals by 2030, and gender equality cuts across all 17 of them. With COVID-19 slowing progress on women\'s rights, the time to act is now. Looking ahead As it stands today, only one indicator under the global goal for gender equality (SDG5) is ‘close to target’: proportion of seats held by women in local government. In other areas critical to women’s empowerment, equality in time spent on unpaid care and domestic work and decision making regarding sexual and reproductive health the world is far from target. Without a bold commitment to accelerate progress, the global community will fail to achieve gender equality. Building forward differently and better will require placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting."}, {\'title\': "The 11 biggest hurdles for women\'s equality by 2030", \'url\': \'https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/feature-story/2023/09/the-11-biggest-hurdles-for-womens-equality-by-2030\', \'content\': "1. Lack of women in leadership With just 27 per cent of parliamentary seats, 36 per cent of local government seats, and 28 per cent of management positions held by women, there is a lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making processes, hindering comprehensive policy formulation. 2. Poverty and lack of economic opportunities More than 340 million women and girls are projected to live in extreme poverty by 2030. This represents a staggering 8 per cent of the global female population surviving on less than USD 2.15 a day. Social protections, access to decent work, and other support systems are urgently needed to provide a path out of poverty. 3. Workplace discrimination and inequalities Only 61 per cent of prime working-age women participate in the labour force, compared to 91 per cent of prime working-age men. This affects both economic growth and societal progress. In 2019, for each dollar men earned in labour income, women earned only 51 cents. 4. An imbalance in unpaid care work On the current trajectory, the gap between the time spent by women and men on unpaid care will narrow slightly, but by 2050, women globally will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time (2.3 more hours per day) on unpaid care work than men. This persistent gap limits women’s participation in education, employment, and other opportunities. 5. Social norms and cultural practices Harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation persist. Globally, one in five young women is married before age 18. The prevalence of child marriage highlights the need for attitudinal shifts and the promotion of legal frameworks that safeguard women and girls’ rights. 6. Inadequate access to education and health care An estimated 110 million girls and young women may remain out of school by 2030. Stalled progress in reducing maternal mortality and expanding educational opportunities call for targeted interventions to meet the 2030 goals. 7. Food insecurity Nearly 24 per cent of women and girls are expected to experience moderate to severe food insecurity by 2030. Empowering women in food and agricultural systems by enhancing access to land and resources is vital for ensuring food security and economic growth. 8. Violence against women and girls Each year, 245 million women and girls experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Older women also face higher rates of poverty and violence than older men. 9. Inadequate funding for gender equality initiatives Only 4 per cent of total bilateral aid is allocated to gender equality and women\'s empowerment. The additional investment needed for achieving gender equality by 2030 is estimated at USD 360 billion per year. 10. Legal barriers and poorly enforced legislation At least 28 countries do not have laws granting women equal rights to enter marriage and initiate divorce, and 67 countries lack laws prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination against women. Where legislation does exist to promote gender equality, effective implementation remains a challenge. 11. Lack of access to clean energy and sanitation An estimated 341 million women and girls are projected to lack electricity by 2030. Universal access could significantly reduce poverty and improve women’s health. With just seven years remaining to achieve the 2030 targets, concerted efforts and funding are more necessary than ever. Each step forward, no matter how incremental, brings us closer to a future where gender equality is not just a goal, but a reality."}, {\'title\': \'Gender equality will take 300 years to achieve, UN chief warns\', \'url\': \'https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/world/un-gender-equality-300-years-intl-hnk/index.html\', \'content\': \'CNN — Progress toward gender equality is “vanishing before our eyes,” United Nations Secretary General António Guterres told the Commission on the Status of Women on Monday. Speaking to the key UN women’s rights group ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8, Guterres said gender equality is “300 years away” according to the latest estimates from UN Women, the UN organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. Guterres cited high rates of maternal mortality, girls being forced into early marriage, and girls being kidnapped and assaulted for attending school as evidence that hope of achieving gender equality “is growing more distant.” In his speech, Guterres did not mention Iran, which was expelled from the 45-member commission in December over protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s so-called “morality police.” “Women’s rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world,” Guterres said, naming a few countries in particular, including Afghanistan, where he said “women and girls have been erased from public life.” On Monday, young Afghan women gathered outside Kabul University to protest the ruling Taliban’s ban on female education, a restriction which a new UN report says may amount to “a crime against humanity.” The report presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday also noted the rise in forced and child marriages, the ban excluding women from other public spaces like parks and gyms, and other restrictions limiting women’s ability to work and travel independently in Afghanistan. Guterres said the deputy secretary-general and the executive director of UN Women recently visited Afghanistan and conveyed to the Taliban authorities that “we will never give up fighting for” women and girls. “Crisis and conflict affect women and girls first and worst,” Guterres said, including the war in Ukraine as an example. Last year, the UN called for an investigation into reports of rape and sexual violence against Ukrainian women and children following Russia’s invasion. Guterres also said that “in many places, women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back,” though he didn’t specify where. Last June, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to abortion up to individual states. The year before, a ban on abortions due to fetal defects took effect in Poland – essentially ending almost all abortions in the country. To achieve gender equality, Guterres called for “collective” and “urgent” action, from increasing education, income and employment for women and girls, especially in developing nations in the Global South, to promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology. “Centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and harmful stereotypes have created a huge gender gap in science and technology,” Guterres said. “Let’s be clear: global frameworks are not working for the world’s women and girls. They need to change.”\'}, {\'title\': \'Gender inequality in the United States - statistics & facts\', \'url\': \'https://www.statista.com/topics/11801/gender-inequality-in-the-united-states/\', \'content\': \'Gender inequalities exist around the world, including in the United States. Although women make up of the U.S. population, they remain minorities within the most elite sectors of society; as of 2023, women constituted of the House of Representatives, the Senate, Fortune 500 CEOs, and governors nationwide. Yet, any female presence in such positions of power demonstrates progress towards the advancement of women’s rights compared to a century ago. Traditionally, American women were excluded from paid work and politics, their capabilities believed to be limited to childcare and housekeeping, while men were seen as the ideal workers without such distractions. Despite subsequent expansion of surrounding gender roles still devalue women’s work to this day. In comparison to men, women in the U.S. . Simultaneously, even though women surpass men on , and even if a woman has a higher degree than a man, it is still likely that the man will Is the future of politics female? According to the 2023 Global Gender Gap report, the United States ranked only 43rd out of 146 countries examined for gender equality by the World Economic Forum, trailing behind neighboring countries Canada and Mexico, who came in 30th and 33rd respectively. The report outlined how the U.S. lost points due to declines in women’s life expectancy and in the amount of women in senior and ministerial positions, although the share of parliamentary positions held by women has increased overall. While high political offices remain dominated by men, more women can now be found in Congress , the House of Representatives and the Senate than ever before. Moreover, despite still lacking a female head of state, Kamala Harris was appointed as the first female Vice President in 2021, suggesting positive trends for female representation in leadership positions in the future. However, a 2023 study found over half of Americans to believe that a major reason behind why there are fewer women than men in high political offices is that women have to do more to prove themselves while a further 44 percent cited that family responsibilities make it harder for women to run for office, demonstrating how lingering assumptions on female capabilities may hinder future advancement of women in American politics. In addition, the study revealed how 50 percent of Americans said that a major reason that women earn less, on average, than men, is that women are treated differently by employers and 42 percent agreed that it was because women tend to make different choices between balancing work and family, further supporting the theory that gender equality in the U.S. remains restricted by outdated gender stereotypes and expectations . A dual burden for mothers Despite having the highest GDP in the world, the United States remains the only OECD country to not offer any form of national paid leave. Even more concerningly, the United States is the only country apart from Papua New Guinea to not offer new mothers some sort of paid maternity leave , instead providing eligible employees with a modest 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for family or medical reasons. However, as women are more likely to work part-time than men, they are therefore less likely to meet eligibility requirements for unpaid leave. Additionally, research has revealed that management and professional occupations provide the most access to paid family leave for their employees, occupations which tend to be dominated by men. As a result, women may struggle to remain in the workforce if they choose to start a family, particularly as studies have shown that outsourcing childcare in the United States is generally considered unaffordable for most families. The high costs of childcare and lack of paid leave mean that many working women in the U.S. must balance work and family responsibilities without assistance, a dual burden which is especially exacerbated for low-income families and single mothers. According to the literature, mothers in the U.S. are often forced to work in low-wage occupations with certain incentives, such as flexible hours, part-time work, and supplied childcare, all of which are rare among higher wage careers. Consequently, single mothers, lacking dual income, tend to be at greater risk of experiencing poverty; comparison of the overall U.S. poverty rate with that of the poverty rate for families who only have a female head of household reveals that poverty is much more prevalent in the latter. As children in the United States are significantly more likely to live with a single mother than a single father , further attention should be given to ensuring that women in such situations can provide for their families and so that mothers nationwide can participate wholly in society, regardless of their assigned gender.

In the United States and around the world, women continue to be underrepresented in high-level, highly paid positions and overrepresented in low-paying jobs. Women of color and transgender individuals experience particularly high levels of poverty, unemployment, and other economic hardships. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace contribute significantly to these persistent economic divides. Gender Income Gaps As of June 2023, the CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations included 52 women – just 10.4 percent of an elite group that earned $16.7 million on average in 2022 . By contrast, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 67.9 percent of workers earning the federal minimum wage, a rate stuck at $7.25 since 2009. Men particularly dominate highly lucrative financial industry jobs. According to Institute for Policy Studies analysis , the share of the five largest U.S. investment banks’ senior executives and top managers who are male: JPMorgan Chase: 71 percent , Goldman Sachs: 77 percent , Bank of America: 63 percent , Morgan Stanley: 76 percent , and Citigroup: 62 percent . Nationwide, men make up 62 percent of all securities industry employees but just a tiny fraction of workers who provide care services that are in high demand but continue to be very low paid. Men make up less than 6 percent of childcare workers, an occupation that pays $26,680 per year , on average. Men make up just 13 percent of home health aides, who average $29,260 per year. The gender gaps at the top of corporate hierarchies are a global phenomenon. According to World Economic Forum analysis of LinkedIn data, women worldwide continue to be outnumbered by men in senior leadership positions across all industries. Overall, women made up just 32.2 percent of senior leadership positions in 2022, nearly 10 percentage points lower than women’s total workforce representation of 41.9 percent. Men make up an overwhelming majority of top earners across the U.S. economy, even though women now represent almost half of the country’s workforce. Women comprise just 27 percent of the top 10 percent, and their share of higher income groups runs even smaller. Among the top 1 percent, women make up slightly less than 17 percent of workers, while at the top 0.1 percent level, they make up only 11 percent, according to a research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research . Other major economies show similar trend lines. A study of eight high-income countries from the London School of Economics found that women made up just 14 percent to 22 percent of the top 1 percent of earners. These surveys were conducted during the 2010-2014 period. The U.S. figure for 2012 is from the National Bureau of Economic Research . Throughout the U.S. workforce, women remain vastly underpaid. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Data finds that among full-time workers, women earned an average of 83 cents for every dollar a man earned in 2021, up from 76 cents in 2001. The narrowing of the pay gap has slowed in the past two decades compared to earlier decades when women were joining the workforce in large numbers. If part-time workers were included in these calculations, the gap would be even wider, since women are more likely to work reduced schedules, often in order to manage childbearing and other caregiving work. Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. American women earn less than men in all industries. The largest pay gaps are in financial and insurance positions, where median earnings for men stood at $103,707 in 2022, compared to just $62,214 for women. The smallest gap appears in the construction sector, but women make up only 10.8 percent of workers in this industry. The U.S. gender pay gap, while unacceptably large, is not the world’s widest. But accurately measuring these gaps across countries can be difficult. Within the OECD group of higher-income nations, South Korea holds the widest gap, with men earning 37 percent more than women, on average. The country with the narrowest gap: Luxembourg, where men make just 3.4 percent more than women. Gaps have been smallest in OECD countries where the share of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements hits at least 80 percent and widest in countries with weak collective bargaining and no or very low minimum wages. The International Labor Organization concedes that more work needs to be done to develop more accurate global gender gap analyses. One factor skewing the numbers: Women do considerably more unpaid work, from housekeeping to caring for children and the elderly. Among the 21 countries reporting data for at least one year during the 2013-2015 period, the West Bank and Gaza had the greatest imbalance, with men devoting just 16 percent as much time to unpaid domestic and caregiving work as women. Belgium, where men spend 63 percent as much time on these activities as women, ranked at the top. Since 2017, the UK government has required corporations with more than 250 employees to disclose the pay gaps between the men and women on their payrolls. Large financial firms have among the widest divides because of the scarcity of women in top positions. In 2022, Goldman Sachs International reported the biggest gap in this sector, with women making just 48.7 cents on average for every $1 earned by men at the bank. Gender Wealth Gaps Most inequality analysis focuses on income (the wages earned from a job or from capital gains) rather than wealth (the sum of one’s assets minus debts). Income inequality, while stark, pales in comparison to wealth inequality. The divides become even more dramatic when viewed through a gender lens. At the top end, we have no more striking sign of increasing global wealth concentration than the rise of the billionaire class . The number of individuals with fortunes worth at least $1 billion has more than doubled since 2010 , while remaining overwhelmingly male. As of March 1, 2023, only 298 women ranked among the world’s 2,489 billionaires, accounting for less than 12 percent. Ninety-one of them hail from the United States, nearly double the number in any other country. The retirement gap is a key factor in our country’s gender inequality. According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies , American women in late 2022 held $44,000 in median retirement savings, compared to $91,000 for men. The gender pay gap contributes to these disparities, since both pension plan and Social Security payouts are partially based on past earnings. In December 2022, women’s average annual Social Security benefit of $19,656 lagged the benefit for men by $4,584. Women’s smaller retirement nest eggs also have to stretch further because women have longer life expectancies. Debt also significantly impacts wealth. Crushing student loan debts drag many young Americans far into the negative side of the wealth line, with women bearing the heaviest burdens. Women comprise 56 percent of college students, but hold nearly two-thirds of outstanding student loan debt, according to the American Association of University Women . Black, Hispanic, and white women are more likely to have student debt than men in their racial or ethnic group. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, Black women are most likely to be shouldering this financial burden. More than 43 percent of this group have student loan debt, compared to less than 16 percent of white men. Gender Poverty Gaps The gender poverty gap has not improved significantly over the past half decade. In 1966, 12.1 percent of women and 8.4 percent of men aged 18-64 lived below the official poverty line. In 2023, 11.2 percent of women in this age group were living in poverty, compared to 8.8 percent of men. In 2023, the poverty threshold for a single person was $14,580 in annual income. Households led by single women with children faced poverty rates of 21.8 percent that year, nearly double the 11.4 percent poverty rate for households led by single men with children, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . Poverty is a particularly acute problem for women of color. In 2023, Native American women had the highest official poverty rate, at 20.4 percent – three times the 6.8 percent poverty rate for white American men. Black women had the second-highest poverty rate, at 16.8 percent, according to the National Women’s Law Center . Transgender Economic Gaps According to a KFF/Washington Post Trans Survey , a larger share of trans adults report being unemployed (14 percent vs. 8 percent) compared to cisgender (non-trans) adults. These findings reflect the significant barriers trans individuals already face in employment access and opportunity. In the National Center for Transgender Equality’s 2022 U.S Trans Survey , more than one in ten (11 percent) of respondents who had ever held a job said they had been fired, forced to resign, or laid off because of their gender identity or expression. People in the LGBTQ+ community tend to earn significantly less than the typical U.S. worker. Transgender women experience the largest gap, earning only 60 cents for every dollar earned by the typical U.S. worker, according to Human Rights Campaign analysis . Trans men earn just 70 percent of U.S. median pay. This analysis focuses only on full-time workers, meaning the wage gap for transgender individuals may be even larger, since they are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. Transgender individuals also experience exceptionally high poverty rates. The Williams Institute at the UCLA Law School analyzed results from CDC surveys conducted between 2014 and 2017. They found that the overall poverty rate among trans people stood at 29.4 percent — nearly twice the 15.7 percent poverty rate among cisgender straight people. Racial and gender disparities further exacerbate the disparities. The Williams Institute found that 38.5 percent of Black transgender and 48.4 percent of Latinx transgender adults were experiencing poverty. White cis-straight men had by far the lowest poverty rate, at just 7.6 percent. Inequality and Reproductive Rights The impact of the Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade will be most severe for low-income people in states with long histories of restricting abortions. As shown by Economic Policy Institute research , many of the states with either trigger laws (which automatically banned abortion upon Roe’s overturn) or pre-Roe abortion bans or restrictions are also states that have not raised their state minimum wage above the federal floor or have rejected federal support to allow Medicaid expansion. Eight states – Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi – have both rejected Medicaid expansion and have a $7.25 minimum wage. Inequality Across Gender Diversity and Covid-19 The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-standing gender inequalities. Women are more likely than men to work in service occupations, including domestic work, restaurant service, retail, tourism, and hospitality, that require face-to-face interactions and have been hard-hit by layoffs. Because of the nature of these jobs, teleworking is not an option for many women. Frontline jobs, which are the ones most often deemed “essential” and require people to work in-person, are also heavily staffed by women. The health care, social work, and government and community-based services occupations are overwhelmingly made up of women, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute . Women make up 73 percent of government and community-based services workers, 76 percent of health care workers, and 78 percent of social workers. The official U.S. unemployment rate does not include people who have not looked for work in the past four weeks. Because women tend to bear more responsibility for family caregiving, women with children were more likely than men to drop out of the labor force when schools and care centers closed due to Covid. Rand Corporation research reveals that the steepest decline in labor force participation in the first phase of the pandemic was among women with two children, at 3.82 points, compared to a 1.39 point drop for men with two children. More recently, the shortage of affordable childcare services has emerged as a barrier for women in returning to jobs in restaurants and other low-wage sectors, contributing to staffing challenges. Among U.S. women who’ve stopped looking for work during the pandemic, the steepest drops have been among women of color. Between February 2020 and November 2021, Black women had a 3.5 percentage point drop in labor force participation and Latinx women had a 2.8 point drop, compared to 1.7 for white women. Several factors may have contributed to women of color becoming discouraged from seeking work. On top of gender inequities, women of color face racial discrimination in hiring and layoffs and they are disproportionately concentrated in service and care sector jobs with high risks of Covid exposure. Transgender people are always in a precarious position, but the Covid-19 pandemic has made them particularly vulnerable. According to research from the Williams Institute at UCLA , transgender Americans are at a higher risk for Covid-19 for several reasons. They are more likely to be low-income, with 47.7 percent of transgender people living below 200 percent of the official U.S. poverty line, compared to 28.9 percent of the general U.S. population. They are also significantly more likely to suffer from asthma and HIV, conditions that put people at higher risk of mortality if they contract Covid-19. And they experience high barriers to receiving health care. The pandemic has also hit transgender Americans especially hard economically. A poll from the Human Rights Campaign and PSB Research shows that as of June 2020, 54 percent of transgender people had experienced reduced work hours — more than double the 23 percent of the total U.S. workforce that faced a similar reduction. Twenty-seven percent of transgender people had experienced pay cuts, compared to just 7 percent of the U.S. workforce. And 19 percent had become unemployed due to the pandemic, a significantly larger share than the general population.\'}, {\'title\': "Women\'s rights are under attack 30 years after leaders adopted a ...", \'url\': \'https://apnews.com/article/un-women-girls-equality-beijing-conference-rights-b009715ff605ccf47f1b72865c7a27e7\', \'content\': \'UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Thirty years after world leaders adopted a historic blueprint to achieve gender equality, a new United Nations report says women’s and girls’ rights are under attack and gender discrimination remains deeply embedded in economies and societies. The report released Thursday by the U.N. agency focused on women’s rights and gender equality found that nearly one-quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash to women’s rights last year. The number of countries reporting a backlash is likely underreported and reflects “an increasingly hostile environment,” UN Women’s policy and program director Sarah Hendriks said at a news conference. “It is not a new phenomenon,” she said. “What is new is that it’s gaining in greater speed and scale and velocity,” especially in very patriarchal and traditional nations where men play a dominant role. The 35 countries reporting a backlash on gender equality came from across the globe and include Spain, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia, Australia, Mongolia, South Africa, Mali and Zimbabwe. Despite some progress, including on girls’ education and access to family planning, UN Women said a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a partner or family member and that cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased by 50% since 2022. The report, released ahead of International Women’s Day on Saturday, also noted that only 87 countries have ever been led by a woman. “Globally, women’s human rights are under attack,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “Instead of mainstreaming equal rights, we’re seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny.” He said the world must stand firm “in making human rights, equality and empowerment a reality for all women and girls, for everyone, everywhere.” The 189 countries that attended a 1995 Beijing women’s conference adopted a landmark declaration and 150-page platform for action to achieve gender equality, calling for bold action in 12 areas, including combating poverty and gender-based violence and putting women at top levels in business, government and at peacemaking tables. It also said for the first time in a U.N. document that human rights include the right of women to control and decide “on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.” In the new review, which includes contributions from 159 countries, UN Women said countries have taken many steps forward on gender equality and women’s rights in the past five years but that such rights still are facing growing threats worldwide. On the positive side , the report said some 88% of countries have passed laws to combat violence against women and established services to help victims in the past five years. Most countries have banned workplace discrimination, and 44% are improving the quality of education and training for girls and women, it said. Yet gender discrimination is deeply embedded, with wide gaps in power and resources that restrain women’s rights, the report said. “The weakening of democratic institutions has gone hand in hand with backlash on gender equality,” UN Women said. It warned that “anti-rights actors are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues” and seeking to block or slow legal and policy gains they can’t roll back. UN Women said almost 25% of countries reported that backlash on gender equality is hampering implementation of the Beijing platform. According to the report, women have only 64% of the legal rights of men, and while the proportion of female lawmakers has more than doubled since 1995, three-quarters of lawmakers are still men. UN Women also said women aged 15 to 24 lag behind other age groups on access to modern family planning; maternal mortality ratios have remained almost unchanged since 2015; and 10% of women and girls live in extremely poor households. The U.N. agency said cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased 50% since 2022 — and women and girls are victims of 95% of these crimes. UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said that based on the report’s findings, the agency has adopted a roadmap to bring the world closer to the U.N. goal of achieving gender equality by 2030. It calls for a digital revolution ensuring equal access to technology for all women and girls; investments in social protections, including universal health care and quality education to lift them out of poverty; and zero violence against girls and women. The roadmap also includes equal decision-making power for women and financing for “gender-responsive humanitarian aid” in conflicts and crises. ___ Lederer was AP’s lead reporter at the 1995 U.N. women’s conference in Beijing.\'}]\n</retrieved data>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:final_answer\nTool\'s parameters:{"reason": "I have gathered sufficient information to answer the question about gender inequality.

But it doesn’t need to. A new global analysis of progress on gender equality and women’s rights shows women and girls remain disproportionately affected by the socioeconomic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, struggling with disproportionately high job and livelihood losses, education disruptions and increased burdens of unpaid care work. Women’s health services, poorly funded even before the pandemic, faced major disruptions, undermining women’s sexual and reproductive health. And despite women’s central role in responding to COVID-19, including as front-line health workers, they are still largely bypassed for leadership positions they deserve. VIDEO UN Women’s latest report, together with UN DESA, Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2021 presents the latest data on gender equality across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The report highlights the progress made since 2015 but also the continued alarm over the COVID-19 pandemic, its immediate effect on women’s well-being and the threat it poses to future generations. We’re breaking down some of the findings from the report, and calling for the action needed to accelerate progress. The pandemic is making matters worse One and a half years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the toll on the poorest and most vulnerable people remains devastating and disproportionate. The combined impact of conflict, extreme weather events and COVID-19 has deprived women and girls of even basic needs such as food security. Without urgent action to stem rising poverty, hunger and inequality, especially in countries affected by conflict and other acute forms of crisis, millions will continue to suffer. A global goal by global goal reality check: Goal 1. Poverty In 2021, extreme poverty is on the rise and progress towards its elimination has reversed. An estimated 435 million women and girls globally are living in extreme poverty. And yet we can change this . Over 150 million women and girls could emerge from poverty by 2030 if governments implement a comprehensive strategy to improve access to education and family planning, achieve equal wages and extend social transfers. Goal 2. Zero hunger The global gender gap in food security has risen dramatically during the pandemic, with more women and girls going hungry. Women’s food insecurity levels were 10 per cent higher than men’s in 2020, compared with 6 per cent higher in 2019. This trend can be reversed , including by supporting women small-scale producers, who typically earn far less than men, through increased funding, training and land rights reforms. Goal 3. Good health and well-being Disruptions in essential health services due to COVID-19 are taking a tragic toll on women and girls. In the first year of the pandemic, there were an estimated 1.4 million additional unintended pregnancies in lower and middle-income countries. We need to do better . Response to the pandemic must include prioritizing sexual and reproductive health services, ensuring they continue to operate safely now and after the pandemic is long over. In addition, more support is needed to ensure life-saving personal protection equipment, tests, oxygen and especially vaccines are available in rich and poor countries alike as well as to vulnerable population within countries. Goal 4. Quality education A year and a half into the pandemic, schools remain partially or fully closed in 42 per cent of the world’s countries and territories. School closures spell lost opportunities for girls and an increased risk of violence, exploitation and early marriage . Governments can do more to protect girls education . Measures focused specifically on supporting girls returning to school are urgently needed, including measures focused on girls from marginalized communities who are most at risk. Goal 5. Gender equality The pandemic has tested and even reversed progress in expanding women’s rights and opportunities. Reports of violence against women and girls, a “shadow” pandemic to COVID-19, are increasing in many parts of the world. COVID-19 is also intensifying women’s workload at home, forcing many to leave the labour force altogether. And yet we can change this . Building forward differently and better will hinge on placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting. Goal 6. Clean water and sanitation In 2018, nearly 2.3 billion people lived in water-stressed countries. Without safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and menstrual hygiene facilities, women and girls find it harder to lead safe, productive and healthy lives. Change is possible . Involve those most impacted in water management processes, including women. Women’s voices are often missing in water management processes. Goal 7. Affordable and clean energy Increased demand for clean energy and low-carbon solutions is driving an unprecedented transformation of the energy sector. But women are being left out. Women hold only 32 per cent of renewable energy jobs. We can do better . Expose girls early on to STEM education, provide training and support to women entering the energy field, close the pay gap and increase women’s leadership in the energy sector. Goal 8. Decent work and economic growth The number of employed women declined by 54 million in 2020 and 45 million women left the labour market altogether. Women have suffered steeper job losses than men, along with increased unpaid care burdens at home. We must do more to support women in the workforce . Guarantee decent work for all, introduce labour laws/reforms, removing legal barriers for married women entering the workforce, support access to affordable/quality childcare. Goal 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure The COVID-19 crisis has spurred striking achievements in medical research and innovation. Women’s contribution has been profound. But still only a little over a third of graduates in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field are female. We can take action today. Quotas mandating that a proportion of research grants are awarded to women-led teams or teams that include women is one concrete way to support women researchers. Goal 10. Reduced inequalities Limited progress for women is being eroded by the pandemic. Women facing multiple forms of discrimination, including women and girls with disabilities, migrant women, women discriminated against because of their race/ethnicity are especially affected. We need to do better . Commit to end racism and discrimination in all its forms, invest in inclusive, universal, gender responsive social protection systems that support all women. Goal 11. Sustainable cities and communities Globally, more than 1 billion people live in informal settlements and slums. Women and girls, often overrepresented in these densely populated areas, suffer from lack of access to basic water and sanitation, health care and transportation. The needs of urban poor women must be prioritized . Increase the provision of durable and adequate housing and equitable access to land; included women in urban planning and development processes. Goal 12. Sustainable consumption and production; Goal 13. Climate action; Goal 14. Life below water; and Goal 15. Life on land Women activists, scientists and researchers are working hard to solve the climate crisis but often without the same platforms as men to share their knowledge and skills. Only 29 per cent of featured speakers at international ocean science conferences are women. And yet we can change this . Ensure women activists, scientists and researchers have equal voice, representation and access to forums where these issues are being discussed and debated. Goal 16. Peace, justice and strong institutions The lack of women in decision-making limits the reach and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergency recovery efforts. In conflict-affected countries, 18.9 per cent of parliamentary seats are held by women, much lower than the global average of 25.6 per cent. This is unacceptable . It\'s time for women to have an equal share of power and decision-making at all levels. Goal 17. Global partnerships for the goals There are just 9 years left to achieve the Global Goals by 2030, and gender equality cuts across all 17 of them. With COVID-19 slowing progress on women\'s rights, the time to act is now. Looking ahead As it stands today, only one indicator under the global goal for gender equality (SDG5) is ‘close to target’: proportion of seats held by women in local government. In other areas critical to women’s empowerment, equality in time spent on unpaid care and domestic work and decision making regarding sexual and reproductive health the world is far from target. Without a bold commitment to accelerate progress, the global community will fail to achieve gender equality. Building forward differently and better will require placing women and girls at the centre of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies and budgeting."}, {\'title\': "The 11 biggest hurdles for women\'s equality by 2030", \'url\': \'https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/feature-story/2023/09/the-11-biggest-hurdles-for-womens-equality-by-2030\', \'content\': "1. Lack of women in leadership With just 27 per cent of parliamentary seats, 36 per cent of local government seats, and 28 per cent of management positions held by women, there is a lack of diverse perspectives in decision-making processes, hindering comprehensive policy formulation. 2. Poverty and lack of economic opportunities More than 340 million women and girls are projected to live in extreme poverty by 2030. This represents a staggering 8 per cent of the global female population surviving on less than USD 2.15 a day. Social protections, access to decent work, and other support systems are urgently needed to provide a path out of poverty. 3. Workplace discrimination and inequalities Only 61 per cent of prime working-age women participate in the labour force, compared to 91 per cent of prime working-age men. This affects both economic growth and societal progress. In 2019, for each dollar men earned in labour income, women earned only 51 cents. 4. An imbalance in unpaid care work On the current trajectory, the gap between the time spent by women and men on unpaid care will narrow slightly, but by 2050, women globally will still be spending 9.5 per cent more time (2.3 more hours per day) on unpaid care work than men. This persistent gap limits women’s participation in education, employment, and other opportunities. 5. Social norms and cultural practices Harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation persist. Globally, one in five young women is married before age 18. The prevalence of child marriage highlights the need for attitudinal shifts and the promotion of legal frameworks that safeguard women and girls’ rights. 6. Inadequate access to education and health care An estimated 110 million girls and young women may remain out of school by 2030. Stalled progress in reducing maternal mortality and expanding educational opportunities call for targeted interventions to meet the 2030 goals. 7. Food insecurity Nearly 24 per cent of women and girls are expected to experience moderate to severe food insecurity by 2030. Empowering women in food and agricultural systems by enhancing access to land and resources is vital for ensuring food security and economic growth. 8. Violence against women and girls Each year, 245 million women and girls experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Older women also face higher rates of poverty and violence than older men. 9. Inadequate funding for gender equality initiatives Only 4 per cent of total bilateral aid is allocated to gender equality and women\'s empowerment. The additional investment needed for achieving gender equality by 2030 is estimated at USD 360 billion per year. 10. Legal barriers and poorly enforced legislation At least 28 countries do not have laws granting women equal rights to enter marriage and initiate divorce, and 67 countries lack laws prohibiting direct and indirect discrimination against women. Where legislation does exist to promote gender equality, effective implementation remains a challenge. 11. Lack of access to clean energy and sanitation An estimated 341 million women and girls are projected to lack electricity by 2030. Universal access could significantly reduce poverty and improve women’s health. With just seven years remaining to achieve the 2030 targets, concerted efforts and funding are more necessary than ever. Each step forward, no matter how incremental, brings us closer to a future where gender equality is not just a goal, but a reality."}, {\'title\': \'Gender equality will take 300 years to achieve, UN chief warns\', \'url\': \'https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/world/un-gender-equality-300-years-intl-hnk/index.html\', \'content\': \'CNN — Progress toward gender equality is “vanishing before our eyes,” United Nations Secretary General António Guterres told the Commission on the Status of Women on Monday. Speaking to the key UN women’s rights group ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8, Guterres said gender equality is “300 years away” according to the latest estimates from UN Women, the UN organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women. Guterres cited high rates of maternal mortality, girls being forced into early marriage, and girls being kidnapped and assaulted for attending school as evidence that hope of achieving gender equality “is growing more distant.” In his speech, Guterres did not mention Iran, which was expelled from the 45-member commission in December over protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s so-called “morality police.” “Women’s rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world,” Guterres said, naming a few countries in particular, including Afghanistan, where he said “women and girls have been erased from public life.” On Monday, young Afghan women gathered outside Kabul University to protest the ruling Taliban’s ban on female education, a restriction which a new UN report says may amount to “a crime against humanity.” The report presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday also noted the rise in forced and child marriages, the ban excluding women from other public spaces like parks and gyms, and other restrictions limiting women’s ability to work and travel independently in Afghanistan. Guterres said the deputy secretary-general and the executive director of UN Women recently visited Afghanistan and conveyed to the Taliban authorities that “we will never give up fighting for” women and girls. “Crisis and conflict affect women and girls first and worst,” Guterres said, including the war in Ukraine as an example. Last year, the UN called for an investigation into reports of rape and sexual violence against Ukrainian women and children following Russia’s invasion. Guterres also said that “in many places, women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back,” though he didn’t specify where. Last June, the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving the right to abortion up to individual states. The year before, a ban on abortions due to fetal defects took effect in Poland – essentially ending almost all abortions in the country. To achieve gender equality, Guterres called for “collective” and “urgent” action, from increasing education, income and employment for women and girls, especially in developing nations in the Global South, to promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology. “Centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and harmful stereotypes have created a huge gender gap in science and technology,” Guterres said. “Let’s be clear: global frameworks are not working for the world’s women and girls. They need to change.”\'}, {\'title\': \'Gender inequality in the United States - statistics & facts\', \'url\': \'https://www.statista.com/topics/11801/gender-inequality-in-the-united-states/\', \'content\': \'Gender inequalities exist around the world, including in the United States. Although women make up of the U.S. population, they remain minorities within the most elite sectors of society; as of 2023, women constituted of the House of Representatives, the Senate, Fortune 500 CEOs, and governors nationwide. Yet, any female presence in such positions of power demonstrates progress towards the advancement of women’s rights compared to a century ago. Traditionally, American women were excluded from paid work and politics, their capabilities believed to be limited to childcare and housekeeping, while men were seen as the ideal workers without such distractions. Despite subsequent expansion of surrounding gender roles still devalue women’s work to this day. In comparison to men, women in the U.S. . Simultaneously, even though women surpass men on , and even if a woman has a higher degree than a man, it is still likely that the man will Is the future of politics female? According to the 2023 Global Gender Gap report, the United States ranked only 43rd out of 146 countries examined for gender equality by the World Economic Forum, trailing behind neighboring countries Canada and Mexico, who came in 30th and 33rd respectively. The report outlined how the U.S. lost points due to declines in women’s life expectancy and in the amount of women in senior and ministerial positions, although the share of parliamentary positions held by women has increased overall. While high political offices remain dominated by men, more women can now be found in Congress , the House of Representatives and the Senate than ever before. Moreover, despite still lacking a female head of state, Kamala Harris was appointed as the first female Vice President in 2021, suggesting positive trends for female representation in leadership positions in the future. However, a 2023 study found over half of Americans to believe that a major reason behind why there are fewer women than men in high political offices is that women have to do more to prove themselves while a further 44 percent cited that family responsibilities make it harder for women to run for office, demonstrating how lingering assumptions on female capabilities may hinder future advancement of women in American politics. In addition, the study revealed how 50 percent of Americans said that a major reason that women earn less, on average, than men, is that women are treated differently by employers and 42 percent agreed that it was because women tend to make different choices between balancing work and family, further supporting the theory that gender equality in the U.S. remains restricted by outdated gender stereotypes and expectations . A dual burden for mothers Despite having the highest GDP in the world, the United States remains the only OECD country to not offer any form of national paid leave. Even more concerningly, the United States is the only country apart from Papua New Guinea to not offer new mothers some sort of paid maternity leave , instead providing eligible employees with a modest 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for family or medical reasons. However, as women are more likely to work part-time than men, they are therefore less likely to meet eligibility requirements for unpaid leave. Additionally, research has revealed that management and professional occupations provide the most access to paid family leave for their employees, occupations which tend to be dominated by men. As a result, women may struggle to remain in the workforce if they choose to start a family, particularly as studies have shown that outsourcing childcare in the United States is generally considered unaffordable for most families. The high costs of childcare and lack of paid leave mean that many working women in the U.S. must balance work and family responsibilities without assistance, a dual burden which is especially exacerbated for low-income families and single mothers. According to the literature, mothers in the U.S. are often forced to work in low-wage occupations with certain incentives, such as flexible hours, part-time work, and supplied childcare, all of which are rare among higher wage careers. Consequently, single mothers, lacking dual income, tend to be at greater risk of experiencing poverty; comparison of the overall U.S. poverty rate with that of the poverty rate for families who only have a female head of household reveals that poverty is much more prevalent in the latter. As children in the United States are significantly more likely to live with a single mother than a single father , further attention should be given to ensuring that women in such situations can provide for their families and so that mothers nationwide can participate wholly in society, regardless of their assigned gender.

In the United States and around the world, women continue to be underrepresented in high-level, highly paid positions and overrepresented in low-paying jobs. Women of color and transgender individuals experience particularly high levels of poverty, unemployment, and other economic hardships. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace contribute significantly to these persistent economic divides. Gender Income Gaps As of June 2023, the CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations included 52 women – just 10.4 percent of an elite group that earned $16.7 million on average in 2022 . By contrast, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 67.9 percent of workers earning the federal minimum wage, a rate stuck at $7.25 since 2009. Men particularly dominate highly lucrative financial industry jobs. According to Institute for Policy Studies analysis , the share of the five largest U.S. investment banks’ senior executives and top managers who are male: JPMorgan Chase: 71 percent , Goldman Sachs: 77 percent , Bank of America: 63 percent , Morgan Stanley: 76 percent , and Citigroup: 62 percent . Nationwide, men make up 62 percent of all securities industry employees but just a tiny fraction of workers who provide care services that are in high demand but continue to be very low paid. Men make up less than 6 percent of childcare workers, an occupation that pays $26,680 per year , on average. Men make up just 13 percent of home health aides, who average $29,260 per year. The gender gaps at the top of corporate hierarchies are a global phenomenon. According to World Economic Forum analysis of LinkedIn data, women worldwide continue to be outnumbered by men in senior leadership positions across all industries. Overall, women made up just 32.2 percent of senior leadership positions in 2022, nearly 10 percentage points lower than women’s total workforce representation of 41.9 percent. Men make up an overwhelming majority of top earners across the U.S. economy, even though women now represent almost half of the country’s workforce. Women comprise just 27 percent of the top 10 percent, and their share of higher income groups runs even smaller. Among the top 1 percent, women make up slightly less than 17 percent of workers, while at the top 0.1 percent level, they make up only 11 percent, according to a research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research . Other major economies show similar trend lines. A study of eight high-income countries from the London School of Economics found that women made up just 14 percent to 22 percent of the top 1 percent of earners. These surveys were conducted during the 2010-2014 period. The U.S. figure for 2012 is from the National Bureau of Economic Research . Throughout the U.S. workforce, women remain vastly underpaid. Institute for Policy Studies analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Data finds that among full-time workers, women earned an average of 83 cents for every dollar a man earned in 2021, up from 76 cents in 2001. The narrowing of the pay gap has slowed in the past two decades compared to earlier decades when women were joining the workforce in large numbers. If part-time workers were included in these calculations, the gap would be even wider, since women are more likely to work reduced schedules, often in order to manage childbearing and other caregiving work. Within racial groups, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the largest pay gaps between men and women appear among whites and Asians — not because Latinas and Black women have made faster progress towards equity but because average pay for men in these groups falls far below the compensation of white and Asian men. Hispanic/Latina women are the lowest-paid of any group, making just 52 cents for every dollar an Asian male earns and 65 cents for every dollar a white male earns. American women earn less than men in all industries. The largest pay gaps are in financial and insurance positions, where median earnings for men stood at $103,707 in 2022, compared to just $62,214 for women. The smallest gap appears in the construction sector, but women make up only 10.8 percent of workers in this industry. The U.S. gender pay gap, while unacceptably large, is not the world’s widest. But accurately measuring these gaps across countries can be difficult. Within the OECD group of higher-income nations, South Korea holds the widest gap, with men earning 37 percent more than women, on average. The country with the narrowest gap: Luxembourg, where men make just 3.4 percent more than women. Gaps have been smallest in OECD countries where the share of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements hits at least 80 percent and widest in countries with weak collective bargaining and no or very low minimum wages. The International Labor Organization concedes that more work needs to be done to develop more accurate global gender gap analyses. One factor skewing the numbers: Women do considerably more unpaid work, from housekeeping to caring for children and the elderly. Among the 21 countries reporting data for at least one year during the 2013-2015 period, the West Bank and Gaza had the greatest imbalance, with men devoting just 16 percent as much time to unpaid domestic and caregiving work as women. Belgium, where men spend 63 percent as much time on these activities as women, ranked at the top. Since 2017, the UK government has required corporations with more than 250 employees to disclose the pay gaps between the men and women on their payrolls. Large financial firms have among the widest divides because of the scarcity of women in top positions. In 2022, Goldman Sachs International reported the biggest gap in this sector, with women making just 48.7 cents on average for every $1 earned by men at the bank. Gender Wealth Gaps Most inequality analysis focuses on income (the wages earned from a job or from capital gains) rather than wealth (the sum of one’s assets minus debts). Income inequality, while stark, pales in comparison to wealth inequality. The divides become even more dramatic when viewed through a gender lens. At the top end, we have no more striking sign of increasing global wealth concentration than the rise of the billionaire class . The number of individuals with fortunes worth at least $1 billion has more than doubled since 2010 , while remaining overwhelmingly male. As of March 1, 2023, only 298 women ranked among the world’s 2,489 billionaires, accounting for less than 12 percent. Ninety-one of them hail from the United States, nearly double the number in any other country. The retirement gap is a key factor in our country’s gender inequality. According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies , American women in late 2022 held $44,000 in median retirement savings, compared to $91,000 for men. The gender pay gap contributes to these disparities, since both pension plan and Social Security payouts are partially based on past earnings. In December 2022, women’s average annual Social Security benefit of $19,656 lagged the benefit for men by $4,584. Women’s smaller retirement nest eggs also have to stretch further because women have longer life expectancies. Debt also significantly impacts wealth. Crushing student loan debts drag many young Americans far into the negative side of the wealth line, with women bearing the heaviest burdens. Women comprise 56 percent of college students, but hold nearly two-thirds of outstanding student loan debt, according to the American Association of University Women . Black, Hispanic, and white women are more likely to have student debt than men in their racial or ethnic group. According to Center for Economic and Policy Research analysis of Americans who have attended college, Black women are most likely to be shouldering this financial burden. More than 43 percent of this group have student loan debt, compared to less than 16 percent of white men. Gender Poverty Gaps The gender poverty gap has not improved significantly over the past half decade. In 1966, 12.1 percent of women and 8.4 percent of men aged 18-64 lived below the official poverty line. In 2023, 11.2 percent of women in this age group were living in poverty, compared to 8.8 percent of men. In 2023, the poverty threshold for a single person was $14,580 in annual income. Households led by single women with children faced poverty rates of 21.8 percent that year, nearly double the 11.4 percent poverty rate for households led by single men with children, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . Poverty is a particularly acute problem for women of color. In 2023, Native American women had the highest official poverty rate, at 20.4 percent – three times the 6.8 percent poverty rate for white American men. Black women had the second-highest poverty rate, at 16.8 percent, according to the National Women’s Law Center . Transgender Economic Gaps According to a KFF/Washington Post Trans Survey , a larger share of trans adults report being unemployed (14 percent vs. 8 percent) compared to cisgender (non-trans) adults. These findings reflect the significant barriers trans individuals already face in employment access and opportunity. In the National Center for Transgender Equality’s 2022 U.S Trans Survey , more than one in ten (11 percent) of respondents who had ever held a job said they had been fired, forced to resign, or laid off because of their gender identity or expression. People in the LGBTQ+ community tend to earn significantly less than the typical U.S. worker. Transgender women experience the largest gap, earning only 60 cents for every dollar earned by the typical U.S. worker, according to Human Rights Campaign analysis . Trans men earn just 70 percent of U.S. median pay. This analysis focuses only on full-time workers, meaning the wage gap for transgender individuals may be even larger, since they are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed. Transgender individuals also experience exceptionally high poverty rates. The Williams Institute at the UCLA Law School analyzed results from CDC surveys conducted between 2014 and 2017. They found that the overall poverty rate among trans people stood at 29.4 percent — nearly twice the 15.7 percent poverty rate among cisgender straight people. Racial and gender disparities further exacerbate the disparities. The Williams Institute found that 38.5 percent of Black transgender and 48.4 percent of Latinx transgender adults were experiencing poverty. White cis-straight men had by far the lowest poverty rate, at just 7.6 percent. Inequality and Reproductive Rights The impact of the Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade will be most severe for low-income people in states with long histories of restricting abortions. As shown by Economic Policy Institute research , many of the states with either trigger laws (which automatically banned abortion upon Roe’s overturn) or pre-Roe abortion bans or restrictions are also states that have not raised their state minimum wage above the federal floor or have rejected federal support to allow Medicaid expansion. Eight states – Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi – have both rejected Medicaid expansion and have a $7.25 minimum wage. Inequality Across Gender Diversity and Covid-19 The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated long-standing gender inequalities. Women are more likely than men to work in service occupations, including domestic work, restaurant service, retail, tourism, and hospitality, that require face-to-face interactions and have been hard-hit by layoffs. Because of the nature of these jobs, teleworking is not an option for many women. Frontline jobs, which are the ones most often deemed “essential” and require people to work in-person, are also heavily staffed by women. The health care, social work, and government and community-based services occupations are overwhelmingly made up of women, according to research from the Economic Policy Institute . Women make up 73 percent of government and community-based services workers, 76 percent of health care workers, and 78 percent of social workers. The official U.S. unemployment rate does not include people who have not looked for work in the past four weeks. Because women tend to bear more responsibility for family caregiving, women with children were more likely than men to drop out of the labor force when schools and care centers closed due to Covid. Rand Corporation research reveals that the steepest decline in labor force participation in the first phase of the pandemic was among women with two children, at 3.82 points, compared to a 1.39 point drop for men with two children. More recently, the shortage of affordable childcare services has emerged as a barrier for women in returning to jobs in restaurants and other low-wage sectors, contributing to staffing challenges. Among U.S. women who’ve stopped looking for work during the pandemic, the steepest drops have been among women of color. Between February 2020 and November 2021, Black women had a 3.5 percentage point drop in labor force participation and Latinx women had a 2.8 point drop, compared to 1.7 for white women. Several factors may have contributed to women of color becoming discouraged from seeking work. On top of gender inequities, women of color face racial discrimination in hiring and layoffs and they are disproportionately concentrated in service and care sector jobs with high risks of Covid exposure. Transgender people are always in a precarious position, but the Covid-19 pandemic has made them particularly vulnerable. According to research from the Williams Institute at UCLA , transgender Americans are at a higher risk for Covid-19 for several reasons. They are more likely to be low-income, with 47.7 percent of transgender people living below 200 percent of the official U.S. poverty line, compared to 28.9 percent of the general U.S. population. They are also significantly more likely to suffer from asthma and HIV, conditions that put people at higher risk of mortality if they contract Covid-19. And they experience high barriers to receiving health care. The pandemic has also hit transgender Americans especially hard economically. A poll from the Human Rights Campaign and PSB Research shows that as of June 2020, 54 percent of transgender people had experienced reduced work hours — more than double the 23 percent of the total U.S. workforce that faced a similar reduction. Twenty-seven percent of transgender people had experienced pay cuts, compared to just 7 percent of the U.S. workforce. And 19 percent had become unemployed due to the pandemic, a significantly larger share than the general population.\'}, {\'title\': "Women\'s rights are under attack 30 years after leaders adopted a ...", \'url\': \'https://apnews.com/article/un-women-girls-equality-beijing-conference-rights-b009715ff605ccf47f1b72865c7a27e7\', \'content\': \'UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Thirty years after world leaders adopted a historic blueprint to achieve gender equality, a new United Nations report says women’s and girls’ rights are under attack and gender discrimination remains deeply embedded in economies and societies. The report released Thursday by the U.N. agency focused on women’s rights and gender equality found that nearly one-quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash to women’s rights last year. The number of countries reporting a backlash is likely underreported and reflects “an increasingly hostile environment,” UN Women’s policy and program director Sarah Hendriks said at a news conference. “It is not a new phenomenon,” she said. “What is new is that it’s gaining in greater speed and scale and velocity,” especially in very patriarchal and traditional nations where men play a dominant role. The 35 countries reporting a backlash on gender equality came from across the globe and include Spain, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia, Australia, Mongolia, South Africa, Mali and Zimbabwe. Despite some progress, including on girls’ education and access to family planning, UN Women said a woman or girl is killed every 10 minutes by a partner or family member and that cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased by 50% since 2022. The report, released ahead of International Women’s Day on Saturday, also noted that only 87 countries have ever been led by a woman. “Globally, women’s human rights are under attack,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. “Instead of mainstreaming equal rights, we’re seeing the mainstreaming of misogyny.” He said the world must stand firm “in making human rights, equality and empowerment a reality for all women and girls, for everyone, everywhere.” The 189 countries that attended a 1995 Beijing women’s conference adopted a landmark declaration and 150-page platform for action to achieve gender equality, calling for bold action in 12 areas, including combating poverty and gender-based violence and putting women at top levels in business, government and at peacemaking tables. It also said for the first time in a U.N. document that human rights include the right of women to control and decide “on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.” In the new review, which includes contributions from 159 countries, UN Women said countries have taken many steps forward on gender equality and women’s rights in the past five years but that such rights still are facing growing threats worldwide. On the positive side , the report said some 88% of countries have passed laws to combat violence against women and established services to help victims in the past five years. Most countries have banned workplace discrimination, and 44% are improving the quality of education and training for girls and women, it said. Yet gender discrimination is deeply embedded, with wide gaps in power and resources that restrain women’s rights, the report said. “The weakening of democratic institutions has gone hand in hand with backlash on gender equality,” UN Women said. It warned that “anti-rights actors are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues” and seeking to block or slow legal and policy gains they can’t roll back. UN Women said almost 25% of countries reported that backlash on gender equality is hampering implementation of the Beijing platform. According to the report, women have only 64% of the legal rights of men, and while the proportion of female lawmakers has more than doubled since 1995, three-quarters of lawmakers are still men. UN Women also said women aged 15 to 24 lag behind other age groups on access to modern family planning; maternal mortality ratios have remained almost unchanged since 2015; and 10% of women and girls live in extremely poor households. The U.N. agency said cases of conflict-related sexual violence have increased 50% since 2022 — and women and girls are victims of 95% of these crimes. UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous said that based on the report’s findings, the agency has adopted a roadmap to bring the world closer to the U.N. goal of achieving gender equality by 2030. It calls for a digital revolution ensuring equal access to technology for all women and girls; investments in social protections, including universal health care and quality education to lift them out of poverty; and zero violence against girls and women. The roadmap also includes equal decision-making power for women and financing for “gender-responsive humanitarian aid” in conflicts and crises. ___ Lederer was AP’s lead reporter at the 1995 U.N. women’s conference in Beijing.\'}]\n</retrieved data>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\'s name:final_answer\nTool\'s parameters:{"reason": "I have gathered sufficient information to answer the question about gender inequality.
