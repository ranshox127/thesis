    "\n",
    "## **Reasoning and Action Rules**\n",
    "1. **Reasoning (Reason)**\n",
    "    - Before taking any action, you must **explain your reasoning**.\n",
    "    - Your reasoning must be concise but informative, summarizing the current situation and justifying the next step.\n",
    "    - If more information is needed, explain why.\n",
    "    - If enough information has been gathered, justify why a final answer can be given.\n",
    "    - **Your reasoning must be included in the `reason` parameter** of the tool call.\n",

    "        - **`search(reason: str, query: str) -> List[Dict]`**\n",

    "            - `reason`: Explain why this search is necessary.\n",

    "        - **`final_answer(reason: str) -> str`**\n",
    "            - Use this tool when you have gathered sufficient information to answer the question.\n",
    "            - `reason`: Explain why the current information is sufficient to generate an answer.\n",

    "## **Observation and Response Rules**\n",

       "\"Based on the information gathered, it is clear that gender inequality is still a significant issue worldwide. Despite some progress in certain areas, the data shows that women's rights are under attack, and gender discrimination remains deeply embedded in economies and societies.\\n\\nThe United Nations report highlights that nearly one-quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash to women's rights last year, and the number of countries reporting a backlash is likely underreported. The report also notes that women have only 64% of the legal rights of men, and while the proportion of female lawmakers has more than doubled since 1995, three-quarters of lawmakers are still men.\\n\\nFurthermore, the report emphasizes that crisis and conflict affect women and girls first and worst, and that women's rights are being abused, threatened, and violated around the world. The data shows that women are disproportionately affected by the socioeconomic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, struggling with high job and livelihood losses, education disruptions, and increased burdens of unpaid care work.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for collective and urgent action to achieve gender equality, including increasing education, income, and employment for women and girls, promoting the participation of women and girls in science and technology, and addressing the gender gap in leadership positions. Additionally, the report stresses the importance of placing women and girls at the center of all aspects of response and recovery, including through gender-responsive laws, policies, and budgeting.\\n\\nIn conclusion, gender inequality is still a significant problem that requires immediate attention and action. The data and reports from the United Nations and other organizations highlight the need for collective effort to address the deeply ingrained gender discrimination and promote equal rights and opportunities for women and girls worldwide.\\n\\nThe final answer to the question is: Yes, gender inequality is still a significant issue that affects women and girls worldwide, and it requires immediate attention and action to address the deeply ingrained gender discrimination and promote equal rights and opportunities.\""
