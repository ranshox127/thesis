For instance, it does not mention Iturbide's focus on personal objects like corsets and crutches that narrate themes of suffering and resilience—a significant aspect of Iturbide’s interpretation that emphasizes emotional depth. The reference also describes how Iturbide diverges from the colorful iconography often associated with Kahlo, instead opting for a more somber portrayal, which the AI assistant fails to highlight. Furthermore, the reference explores Iturbide's integration of her own life experiences with Kahlo’s legacy, a layer of interpretation that is missing from the AI's response.\n\n2.

It describes the signs and causes of demotivation, mentions specific strategies for improving motivation, and cites the consequences of demotivation on productivity, which aligns well with the reference answer. However, it misses some points that the reference answer includes, such as specific consequences on turnover rates and workplace culture in detail. The assistant's answer also touches on how to measure the impact of demotivation, which is a valuable addition absent in the reference answer.
