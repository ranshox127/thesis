However, it lacks the level of detail found in the reference answer. For example, the reference answer breaks down the environmental and social aspects into specific positive and negative features, providing a balanced view.\\n   - The AI's response introduces an additional dimension \\u2014 comparative sustainability with other energy sources \\u2014 that was not explicitly addressed in the reference but could be considered relevant. However, this section could have been more concise or integrated into the existing categories.\\n   - The reference answer discusses the need for sustainable practices and economic incentives more explicitly as part of the conclusion, which provides a clear takeaway for ensuring biodiesel sustainability.\\n   \\n2. **Evaluation:**\\n\\n   - **Factuality:** The AI assistant's answer provides a generally accurate representation of the biodiversity sustainability landscape. While the information is largely correct, it could be enhanced by citing specific statistics or studies to substantiate its claims.

However, the unnecessary additional section slightly impacts coherence, as it diverges from the user's core inquiry. Score: 7.\\n\\n   - **Completeness:** The AI assistant's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the topic but lacks the depth and nuance of the reference answer, which explores each factor in greater detail. The assistant could have offered specifics on strategies like land use regulation and sustainable practices. Score: 7.\\n\\n3. **Final Score:**\\n   - Considering the criteria evaluations, the AI assistant's response is informative and reasonably well-structured but misses the depth and focus present in the reference.

It covers key points such as the establishment of the Dominion of New England, the Glorious Revolution, and economic policies like the Navigation Acts. \\n   - However, the AI assistant's answer lacks some detail found in the reference, such as the implications of these events on the colonies' concepts of liberty and governance. The reference answer provides a nuanced view of the social and ideological impact of these events, which is only partly covered in the AI answer.\\n   - The AI assistant does mention the Boston Revolt of 1689, which adds a specific example of colonial unrest that the reference answer doesn't include.\\n\\n2. **Evaluation**:\\n   - **Factuality**: The AI assistant's response is factually accurate, mentioning critical events of the 1680s. However, it can slightly enhance its factual content by elaborating on the precise consequences of each event on the colonies. Score: 8.\\n   - **User Satisfaction**: The response addresses the user's question effectively, presenting an overview of the causes of tension between Britain and the American colonies. However, it omits some of the deeper social and ideological analysis found in the reference.

The AI assistant's answer covers many of the same points as the reference answer, such as economic factors, skills mismatches, demographic and geographic issues, and employer expectations. However, the AI answer introduces a new category of \\\"Social and Cultural Perceptions,\\\" which wasn't addressed in the reference answer. While potentially relevant, it diverges from the core economic and demographic factors more directly tied to the original question. The AI's coverage of economic factors also includes more specific details about inflation and immigration, which adds depth but could stray away from the primary points if not balanced correctly. Both responses suggest strategies for addressing these challenges, but the AI's final summary slightly lacks the nuanced solution-oriented approach seen in the reference answer.\\n\\n2. **Factuality**: The AI response is factually accurate and aligns well with current economic theories regarding labor markets. However, the detail on \\\"Social and Cultural Perceptions\\\" is more abstract and less supported by specific data in this context.

Including \\\"Social and Cultural Perceptions\\\" without clear relevance may also detract from clarity. Score: 8.\\n\\n5. **Logical Coherence**: The AI's answer follows a logical structure and maintains consistency throughout. However, including \\\"Social and Cultural Perceptions\\\" might slightly break the logical flow when the key focus should be on economic and skills issues.

      "[{'agent': 'planner', 'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a Planner Agent designed to reason through complex, open-ended, or ambiguous questions by constructing, reflecting on, and expanding a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interrelated sub-questions. Your task is not simply to retrieve answers, but to actively explore the question space, refine your understanding, and make informed decisions about when the original question has been sufficiently addressed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Problem Space Representation: The Question DAG\\n\\nThe DAG is your evolving internal model of the problem. It represents your reasoning process — how the main question relates to sub-questions, intermediate knowledge, and reflections.\\nEach node contains:\\n- `node_id`: a unique identifier\\n- `question`: a sub-question or original question\\n- `annotation`: your current thoughts, insights, summaries, or hypotheses about that question\\n\\nEach annotation helps build and maintain your internal representation of the problem. For example:\\n- A node’s `annotation` may include:\\n  - A summary of what you currently understand about the question\\n  - A hypothesis or assumption you are testing\\n  - A brief note on what you still need to find out\\n- An `edge_annotation` should briefly explain how the sub-question contributes to answering the parent question — e.g., cause-effect, component, condition, clarification, definition, comparison, or implication.\\n---\\n\\n## Input Format\\n\\nYou are always shown the current DAG in JSON format, including all nodes and edges, representing the most up-to-date state of your reasoning process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Reasoning Guidelines\\n\\n- You cannot delete nodes or edges. Even if a previous path turns out to be incorrect or irrelevant, leave it intact and revise your understanding through `update()`. This mimics how humans preserve earlier lines of thought for traceability, reflection, and learning from missteps.\\n- You are encouraged to **revisit and revise** previous thoughts using `update`, especially as new information or sub-answers emerge.\\n- When decomposing, focus on asking the right questions — use logical, causal, definitional, or investigative angles that deepen your understanding.\\n- When unsure or the question is broad, **start by clarifying or framing the problem**, not jumping to answers.\\n- For vague or ill-defined questions, take initiative to deconstruct ambiguity, identify what is missing, and reframe as needed.

You may decompose multiple nodes at once.\\n   - Specify `parent_question_id`, `sub_question`, and an `edge_annotation` explaining the logical or conceptual relationship.\\n   - Multiple parents pointing to the same sub-question are allowed.\\n   - Keep the graph acyclic.\\n\\n   Example:\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \"graph\": [\\n       {\\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\\n         \"sub_question\": \"How has telework affected work-life boundaries?\",\\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding personal impact helps assess broader social shifts.\"\\n       },\\n       {\\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q.1\",\\n         \"sub_question\": \"Does telework reinforce or reduce social inequality?\",\\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Social impact includes distributional effects across groups.\"\\n       }\\n     ]\\n   }\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **update**\\n    Use this to revise or expand the annotation of existing nodes.\\n    - This reflects new insights, summaries, clarifications, or changes in understanding.\\n    - You are encouraged to use this tool to reflect, correct, or reframe — especially after learning something new.\\n    - This is a key part of your **metacognitive behavior** — thinking about your thinking.\\n\\n    Example:\\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \"nodes\": [\\n        {\\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.1\",\\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Workers report blurred boundaries between home and work, leading to both flexibility and stress.\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"question_id\": \"Q.2\",\\n          \"new_annotation\": \"Emerging evidence suggests that higher-income workers benefit more from telework options, widening inequality.\"\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n3.  **final_answer**\\n    Use this only when you believe the original question has been sufficiently addressed **given the available steps so far**.  \\n    You do not need perfect certainty — you must simply provide a reason why the current DAG gives you enough understanding to form a meaningful answer.\\n    - Provide a justification explaining why you believe your DAG now contains enough understanding.\\n    - Your answer should be clear, comprehensive, and informative—sufficient in length to convey key insights.\\n    - You may use paragraph or bullet point format as appropriate.\\n    - Aim to include key aspects uncovered in the DAG — such as causes, mechanisms, consequences, or trade-offs — without repeating every detail.\\n\\n    Example:\\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \"reason\": \"The sub-questions cover key social dimensions — lifestyle, geography, and inequality — and their annotations provide sufficient insight.\",\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Metacognitive Expectations\\n\\nThis is not a static search task — it is an evolving thinking process.\\n\\n- Use `update()` to **reflect**, summarize new insights, question assumptions, or refine your current framing.\\n- Use `question_decompose()` to **expand the problem space**, identify what needs to be known, or clarify uncertainty.\\n- Use `final_answer()` only when your internal model (the DAG) gives you enough confidence that you can answer well.\\n- At each step, treat the DAG as your evolving internal model of understanding — be thoughtful about how you build it.\\n\\n- When starting from a single root question with no sub-questions yet, you may choose to either:\\n  - Use `update()` to record your initial thoughts, assumptions, or possible lines of inquiry, or\\n  - Use `question_decompose()` to begin breaking down the problem into more specific components.\\nThere is no fixed preference — use your best judgment based on the question’s clarity and complexity.'}, {'agent': 'planner', 'role': 'user', 'content': '{\\n  \"nodes\": [\\n    {\\n      \"node_id\": \"Q\",\\n      \"question\": \"how did ww2 challenge society views on women\",\\n      \"annotation\": \"\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"edges\": []\\n}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool\\'s name:question_decompose\\nTool\\'s parameters:{\\n     \"graph\": [\\n       {\\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\\n         \"sub_question\": \"What were the primary social roles of women before WW2?\",\\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Understanding the baseline helps assess the impact of WW2 on societal views.\"\\n       },\\n       {\\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\\n         \"sub_question\": \"How did women\\'s participation in the workforce change during WW2?\",\\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"The shift in workforce participation is a key indicator of changing social views.\"\\n       },\\n       {\\n         \"parent_question_id\": \"Q\",\\n         \"sub_question\": \"What role did women play in the military and defense industries during WW2?\",\\n         \"edge_annotation\": \"Women\\'s direct involvement in the war effort reflects significant changes in societal perceptions.\"\\n       }\\n     ]\\n   }', 'agent': 'planner'}, {'agent': 'searcher', 'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a research assistant in a multi-agent system designed to answer complex and ambiguous questions.

The women\\\\\\'s movement, with its emphasis on advocacy of equal rights, newly formed women\\\\\\'s organizations, and the rise of a new generation of female artists, photographers, and professionals, transformed the traditional patriarchal social structure across the globe. Followed closely by the advent of World War I , these social shifts, which had been set in motion at the beginning of the century, developed further as women were propelled into the workforce, exposing them to previously male-dominated professional and political situations. By the midpoint of the twentieth century, women\\\\\\'s activities and concerns had been recognized as a significant element of the literary, scientific, and cultural landscape of several countries, marking a revolutionary change in the social and domestic roles of women. The end of the nineteenth century saw tremendous growth in the suffrage movement in England and the United States , with women struggling to attain political equality. The suffragists—who were often militant in their expressions of protest—presented a sometimes stark contrast to the feminine ideal of the era, which portrayed women as delicate, demure, and silent, confined to a domestic world that cocooned them from the harsh realities of the world. Despite many challenges English and American women eventually won the right to vote, in part due to the changed perception of women\\\\\\'s abilities following World War I . As men were called to war, companies that had previously limited employment in better-paying jobs to white males found themselves opening their doors to white women and women and men of color. Racial and gender tensions escalated during this time, and many jobs were in fact permanently redefined as \"women\\\\\\'s work,\" including teaching, nursing, secretarial work, and telephone operations. As well as functioning in the workforce, women actively participated in the political and cultural life of England and the United States . The early decades of the twentieth century, often referred to as the Progressive Era, saw the emergence of a new image of women in society which had undergone a marked transformation from the demure, frail, female stereotype of the late Victorian Era. The women of the Progressive Era, according to Sarah Jane Deutsch, were portrayed as \"women with short hair and short skirts … kicking up their legs and kicking off a century of social restrictions.\" Progressive women smoked, danced in public, held jobs, and generally did most things that nineteenth-century women were barred from doing. However, Deutsch asserts that this image of the 1920s \"flapper\" was restricted to certain portions of the population, namely white, young, and middle-class communities. Women elsewhere, particularly women from other ethnic backgrounds, such as African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Hispanics, lived much differently, struggling in their new roles as mothers and professionals. The number of women who worked outside the home in the 1920s rose almost 50 percent throughout the decade. While women still constituted a small number of the professional population, they were slowly increasing their participation in more significant occupations, including law, social work , engineering, and medicine. The presence of a large class of young working women after World War I was reflected in what had become a major cultural force—the film industry. Nevertheless, films of the era continued to reinforce outdated stereotypes about women\\\\\\'s place in society. While early cinematic storylines often featured poor women finding success and contentment through marriage to rich men, the films of the 1920s depicted young, feisty working women who, like their predecessors, could attain true happiness only by marrying their bosses. Such plotlines helped many to cope with the growing fear that the domestic and family structure of society was being eroded by the emergence of the new, independent woman. Rarely did depictions of women in mass media, including film, radio, and theater, convey the true circumstances of working women. Instead, audiences were presented with images of flappers or visions of glorified motherhood and marriage. Women in the early twentieth century were perhaps most active and influential as writers and artists. The advent of the new century did witness a change in the style and content of women\\\\\\'s writing, as well as an increase in the depiction of feminine images and themes in literature. Male authors such as D. H. Lawrence and W. D. Howells explored issues pertaining to sexuality and the newly redefined sexual politics between men and women. Women authors such as Dorothy Richardson, May Sinclair, and Katherine Mansfield focused on topics pertinent to women, bringing attention to the myriad difficulties they faced redefining their identities in a changing world. Other major women writers of the period included Gertrude Stein , Virginia Woolf, Charlotte Perkins Gilman , and Edith Wharton. In the arena of art, the early twentieth century provided growing opportunities for women to exhibit their work. In 1914, for example, the National Academy of Design first allowed women to attend anatomy lectures, thus providing them with a chance to study draftsmanship and develop drawing skills in a formal setting. Such artists as Emerson Baum and photographers like Alfred Steiglitz helped promote exhibitions of women\\\\\\'s art, including the works of Imogen Cunningham and Georgia O\\\\\\'Keefe. Many female artists—among them Dorothea Lange and Claire Leighton—used their talents to highlight the social realities of their times, and some of the most powerful images of this period, including stirring portrayals of coal miners and farmers, were produced by these women. By the mid-twentieth century, women throughout the Western world had completely redefined their roles in almost every social, political, and cultural sphere. While the fight for equal rights and recognition for women would continue into the 1950s and beyond, the first major steps towards such changes began at the advent of the twentieth century, with women writers, photographers, artists, activists, and workers blazing a new trail for generations of women to follow.\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'What Were the Traditional Gender Roles of Men & Women in the 1900s?\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://oureverydaylife.com/were-roles-men-women-1900s-8623722.html\\', \\'content\\': \\'Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images Preconceived notions of gender roles from the 19th Century continued well into that of the 20th Century. The Industrial Revolution placed women in roles of domesticity, while men earned wages and supported families. Toward the middle of the century, these roles became less defined, although women continued to work in subordinate positions and for less pay Work At the beginning of the 20th Century, middle class families were largely composed of one income-earner, the male. Economic programs known as the New Deal, implemented between 1933 and 1936, further supported this structure. By 1940, however, the burdens imposed by war forced many families to collectively support each other. Women accepted lodgers while their men were away at war and performed sewing and laundry to supplement male wages. In the 1960s, an increasing number of married women held formal jobs and 45 percent of the total workforce in 1989 consisted of women. They worked most commonly in clerical, service and factory environments. Men, meanwhile, held decision-making positions and dominated earned wages. Home Up to the 19th Century, American women toiled at home to educate children, manufacture goods for general consumption and maintain farms. This enabled men to plow and harvest crops, but such roles changed with America\\\\\\'s Industrial Revolution. Women were then free to raise children and manage the housekeeping, as men were expected for the first time to leave the homestead and earn wages. During World War II, men were called to battle lines and women forced from home to hold college seats and work. After the war, men returned home and reclaimed most jobs, thus leaving women once more to continue serving as wives and mothers. In the 1950s, women were expected to create inviting homes for men who worked all day. Not until the 1960s did females profoundly impact the workforce. Religion and Morality Through the late 1800s and early 1900s, women were perceived as more morally upright than men. They were thus considered to be the backbone of familial morals, and added to this was the belief that females were more religious than males. This is largely because women composed the greatest number of church attendants, although men dominated the roles of religious leaders. While women attended church, men questioned the existence of a god. This struggle was identified in the April 1949 issue of \"Time\" magazine with an article titled, \"Where is Man?: Morals.\" Therein, morality was described as a relative issue, whereby one idea of right and wrong could be found as compelling as another, with no reference to women. Politics In the early 20th Century, women\\\\\\'s suffrage was a pressing issue. At this time, the male-only government was believed to implement specific strategies to keep women out of the workplace, muffle their political concerns and retain them at home. One such strategy was the diminished access of birth control. After the 19th Amendment passed in 1920, women voted with their husbands and fathers, generally adhering to their beliefs because of shared concerns in social and economical matters. In the 1960s, men led protests concerning government involvement overseas and civil rights. Women also began to protest, but with different intentions because the male population collectively labeled them as inferior. Their arguments thus focused on exclusion from leadership roles and male-dominated work positions.\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Evolution of American Women in the 20th Century: Progress - CliffsNotes\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-notes/19222315\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'The Changing Role of Women - Women of the 20th Century - Weebly\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://womeninthe20thcenturyproject.weebly.com/the-changing-role-of-women.html\\', \\'content\\': \\'The Changing Role of Women Life for women in the 1900s was drastically different than it is today. Queen Victoria, ironically enough, brought the nearly exclusively man-run world into the 20th century and influenced the 1910’s even past her 1901 death. However, the average woman, though not theoretically seen as unimportant was considered less important than a man. Women were the weaker sex, needed protection, and were fragile beings not capable of doing everything a man could. It was considered taboo for women to own a business, support herself, or attend college. After all, these endeavours threatened the male-orientated standards of the day. Married women lost the right to own property, couldn’t make legal contracts, and laws made it nearly impossible for a woman to end an abusive marriage (\"January 1, 1900\"). While women could actually vote municipally in four provinces, they were prohibited from voting provincially or federally, and could not run for office. At the turn of the century, women were slowly emerging from homebound producers to wage-earning consumers. Yet, despite the rise of women\\\\\\'s importance on the economic, social, and political scene, many men still did not view them as strong, productive, or politically active members of society. Women were simply not valued the same as men. In fact, it was only in 1909, that the Criminal Code was amended to outlaw the abduction of women (Harvey). Before this, unless a woman was under 16 or an heiress, the abduction of any woman was legal. Even more surprising, the maximum penalty for stealing a cow carried a much stiffer penalty than that given for kidnapping an heiress (Harvey)! During this decade, women wore their hair up in neat little buns and were not allowed to drink or smoke. In fact, in many places, they could be arrested for smoking in public. Most women wore corsets and other painful disfiguring garments to present a slender appearance. And yet, while the women of the 1900’s faced many restrictions, some monumental events in the slow “freeing” of the fairer gender still occurred. Helen Keller was the first blind/deaf woman to enter and graduate from college (\"Decade by Decade: 1900s\"). The Women’s Trade Union League was founded to help working women organize in 1903 (\"January 1, 1900\"). International Women’s Day was celebrated for the first time in 1908, and many reformers became historical figures of great significance, such as Jane Adams (\"Decade by Decade: 1900s\"). In the family, in most cases, the women stayed at home as mothers and housewives while the men made the family income. Women were expected to prepare all the meals on time, keep the house spotless, have and raise children, be “ladylike” and charming at all times, keep out of “male business” and magazines, always be properly dressed and proper in general, and please her husband and his guests. A woman’s place was in the home…and that was that. For women to work outside the home, it had to be out of sheer necessity in the 1900’s, not as a privilege or a right. Of the mere 13% of women in the workforce, many suffered miserably in crowded factories and mills with unfair wages and conditions (\"January 1, 1900\"). The more fortunate were teachers, nurses, typists/secretaries, and sales clerks. Yet, even as early as the 1900\\\\\\'s, some women were entering traditional male careers such as law, medicine, and science, with some women practicing medicine and law in Canada. While so many married women barely left the house, this new breed of women left the house for work and leisure. With this new independence, these women began to explore activeness in society. The suffragette movement was spreading and growing in the 1910s. However, with the beginning of the Great War, in 1914, women around the world put on hold their campaigns for womens\\\\\\' rights in order to help the war effort. The mass recruitment of men was actually damaging the war effort - by spring 1915, the supply of shells to the front was running short. It became clear that there were two options: either men from the front would have to return to make ammunition instead of firing it, or women would have to take over their roles. In the early months, working-class women only worked \\\\\\'suitable\\\\\\' trades, such as shoemaking, baking, and printing. However, with the labor shortage, women were soon being employed in industrial jobs previously regarded as the preserve of skilled artisans (The British Homefront, 3). By 1917 there were 35 000 women employed in munitions factories in Ontario and Montréal (The Canadian Encyclopedia). However, filling shells in munition factories was one of the worst jobs during the war. The women in the factories were nicknamed canaries, because the repeated exposure to TNT turned their faces yellow. The pay was good, but the health risks were abominable. Canaries suffered from skin and lung diseases, and women frequently were blinded or lost fingers while handling the explosives. In 1917 a fire broke out in a high-explosives factory at Silvertown, in east London, England. The resulting explosion was heard 50 miles away in Cambridge and 69 people in the factory and on the adjoining streets were killed instantly. Almost a thousand more were injured, 98 of them seriously (BBC, 2). Despite the tragedies, this change in women\\\\\\'s work brought unexpected benefits. Their wages increased during the war years, they never equalled men\\\\\\'s; in the munitions factories women\\\\\\'s wages were 50-80% of those paid men, but suddenly women ceased to see themselves as fragile social ornaments . They no longer felt the need to male company while dining out - business girls ate out alone, or with each other, smoked cigarettes in public, and wore makeup. Clothes became more practical, and some young women - especially those working in factories or fields - took to wearing trousers. When the Great War finally came to an end on November 11, 1918, 12 million people had died. A Women\\\\\\'s War Conference was called in 1918 by the federal government to discuss the continuing role of women, who took the opportunity to raise a number of political issues, including suffrage. Despite being put on hold due to the Great War, in 1916 Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta had given women the provincial vote; Ontario and BC followed in 1917. On 24 May 1918 the Parliament of Canada bestowed the federal franchise on women (The Canadian Encyclopedia). The “roaring twenties” or “golden years” were fascinating times! It was a time of liberation and rebellion for women across the globe. Once the war was over, they were once again demanding women\\\\\\'s rights, although this time, it was for different reasons. They mainly wanted the right to work in certain fields and work place and wanted to be legally categorized as \"persons\" (Simon, Amici, and Jamie Huang). After WWI, some women chose to stay in the workforce even though the men were coming back to their old jobs. They were still secretaries, teachers, nurses, and seamstresses like they were pre-war, but many decided to remain doing the jobs they did during the war. Now that they were not as needed, educated women were encouraged to stick to “nurturing” type jobs such as social work, nursing, teaching, and pediatrics. Many also worked in factories in the garment industry. Now despite how it sounds like women completely went back to their own ways, the 1920\\\\\\'s were an era of firsts for many things, from the first shorts and fitted bathing suits worn by women, to the present idea of dating. There were also political achievements. In 1921, Agnes MacPhail was the first woman to be elected as a federal member (\"Decade by Decade: 1920s\"). Also, through the Persons Case, women in Canada became eligible for senatorial appointment in 1929 (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). Women such as Emily Carr and Mazo de la Roche became very successful in the arts of painting and writing respectively (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). Women gained the right to vote in the US and the National American Woman Suffrage Association became the League of Women Voters (\"Decade by Decade: 1920s\"). However a thing to remember is that, in Canada, Aboriginal and Asian women were excluded from those who got the right to vote. During this time, there was a huge social rebellion with the emergence of the flapper. Flappers were mostly young women, and they lived as examples that women had the freedom and right to enjoy everything that a man did. Sleeveless dresses appeared, necklines dropped, and hem lines rose above the knee. The typical flapper was a young woman who danced provocatively, drank, wore heavy makeup, and dated freely. They had short flowy dresses, short hair, loved hats, and wore beads, sequins, and peacock feathers. It may not seem like such a big deal, but these women also smoked! Smoking often was not allowed in public where women were concerned. It was considered sinful and unladylike. The media eventually jumped in the bandwagon and actually encouraged weight-conscious flappers to smoke instead of eat sweets (Simon, Amici, and Jamie Huang). It was addicting enjoyable, without the added calories. Women during the time also began to ride bicycles, drive cars, and openly drink alcohol (in contrast to those in the Women’s Christian Temperance Union). The older generation was shocked! Sleeveless dresses appeared, necklines dropped, hem lines rose to the knee, the scandalous Charleston being popular, and long hair was bobbed. Forget corsets! Undergarments allowed more movement and comfort with the ability to be more involved in dance and sports and bathing suits became form flattering, practical, and colourful. As we leave the twenties, women are earning 39% of US college degrees, they can compete in Olympic field events, women’s baseball is popular, women are questioning their rights on whether they have children or not, and they supposedly gain equal rights (\"Decade by Decade: 1920s\"). And as we look back, we can see that it certainly was a time of change. By 1930, women were entering universities in large numbers; 23% of all undergraduates and 35% of all graduate students were female. The Great Depression reversed this trend and in the 1930s many women were forced back into domestic service. Canadian federal employment figures show that even in the garment industry - a longtime employer of women - they were being laid off at a higher rate than men (The Canadian Encyclopedia). The Great Depression of the \\\\\\'threadbare Thirties\\\\\\' was taking its toll. It left millions of Canadians unemployed, hungry and often homeless. Due to Canada’s heavy dependence on raw material and farm exports, combined with a crippling Prairies drought, few countries felt the effects of the depression as much as Canada. Between 1929 and 1933 the country’s Gross National Expenditure (overall public and private spending) fell by 42%. By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one in five Canadians had become dependent upon government relief for survival (The Canadian Encyclopedia). Despite the horrific poverty of the Depression, the 1930s was a decade of firsts for women. In 1931, Jane Addams became the first woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the poor in Chicago. Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932. On 6 March 1933, two days after becoming First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt held what was to become the first of 348 press conferences, with about 35 women in attendance. The idea emerged from her flourishing friendship with reporter Lorena Hickok as a direct measure to help women reporters keep their jobs during the depression. In these conferences, Mrs. Roosevelt informed the American people of news, whether it was the threat that Hitler presented to Europe or of her own life in the White House. The conferences were a unique situation, as they were banned to all men. This was a direct measure to help women reporters keep their jobs during the depression, as it required the publication companies that wanted to carry the news which Mrs. Roosevelt generated to continue to employ women reporters (First Ladies). Previous to this, women reporters in Washington were confined to coverage of “style” issues, such as clothes and entertaining. Just as the world was climbing back to its feet, disaster struck once again with the commencement of World War II, when Germany attacked Poland on September 1, 1939. Women of the forties were vital in the war effort. For the ladies, WWII mirrored WWI in many ways. WWII erupted and women were again to dutifully take over all the jobs left behind. As Canada entered WWII there was a high rate of unemployment, but by 1942, there was a labour shortage and everyone was needed to help out. A federal National Selective Service program was implemented to recruit single women for employment, but soon came to recruit married, childless women, and eventually married women with children when the labour shortage continued (\"Women at Work\"). Propaganda was created to lure women into the work force. “Rosie the Riveter” – a fictional character depicting the “ideal” woman worker – was created. The character was an instant media success, and the “Rosie the Riveter” song came out in 1942 (\"Women at Work\"). Working women were the country’s safety net! They filled the jobs of men, did anything and everything, supported both their families and themselves, and did all of this, while facing harassment from men (\"Women at Work\"). One issue was childcare, and daycares were soon opened. The main obstacle, however, was changing men’s attitudes. Working was not new to women, and everyone – including the men – agreed that workers were greatly needed, but they also agreed that it would only be temporary. Male employees were suspicious of women; women’s needs were secondary to men’s; and positions of power were denied to them (\"Women at Work\"). As time went on, these attitudes drastically changed and employers eventually praised them. But, as soon as the war was over women were encouraged to leave work to make way for returning soldiers. Many were laid off or cut back into lower paying “female” jobs. The majority of women returned to the home, but the idea of married women working stayed with women everywhere, and married women soon became fixed members of the working world. Outside of the war effort, there were many other achievements. Québec women were able to practice law, and high jumper Alice Coachman became the first African American woman to win an Olympic gold medal (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). Chinese and Japanese women – and men – obtained the right to vote, and Canadian women no longer lost their citizenship automatically if they married non-Canadians (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). Women’s clothing of the forties was typically modeled after the utility clothes produced during war rationing. Tailored suits, square shoulders, narrow hips, and skirts that ended just below the knee were the height of fashion. After the war, it was back to a more feminine style, but most excitedly – during the war – slacks first gained popularity! With war rations being abolished, the modern supermarket making its appearance, the television popularizing, and the coronation of a new the Queen (Elizabeth II), the 1950s was a time of relatively peaceful change. After WWII, women were, as in the case of WWI, expected to return to the home, and many did, but, again, many did not. In England, one in five married women went to work in 1951; by 1957 the figure was one in three (Porter). There was a dramatic increase in birth rates, and new housing was impacting the landscape. The development of better cars in the 50\\\\\\'s led to the birth of the \\\\\\'commuter age\\\\\\', with the first suburbs beginning to emerge. New sets of values appeared; there was pressure to “maintain appearances” within your town, so more families attended church, community social functions, etc. On average, mothers did 99 hours of housework each week. With an increase in televisions, the entertainment industry was booming, and TV dramas and comedies, like Father Knows Best and Leave It To Beaver re-enforced the idea of a nuclear family and gender stereotypes. After WWII, technology started changing the way beauty was perceived: bathrooms with electric lights and mirrors highlighted concerns about acne and formerly overlooked details (Porter). Actress Marilyn Monroe was perceived as the epitome of beauty in the 50s. The pressure to live up the ideal was tough and demanding, similar to today’s pressure of the ‘slim ideal’. In the words of The Happy Home (a book published by the Good Housekeeping Institute), \"Your choice of clothes and the way you wear them, your walk, your hairstyle, hands and makeup - all these tell what kind of woman you are. However, not all was peaceful as the Soviet Union and the United States faced off in the Cold War, that had started in 1945 and would continue until 1991. \"Everywhere are evidences of the continuous underground, cancerous movements of Communism ... Only eternal vigilance can protect us against Communism and its infiltration into our way of life.\" - Canadair advertisement, 1955 It was a decade of extremes, in the 1960s. From transformational changes to peculiar contrasts, this decade was marked by everything from flower power to rebellion, to backlash. More females than ever entered the paid workforce. With this, women’s dissatisfaction regarding the huge discrepancies in pay and advancement between the genders as well as workplace sexual harassment grew (Napikoski). Yet, even with this strong presence, women still only earned 60% of the earnings of a man (\"Decade by Decade: 1960s\"). During the radical 60’s, it was no longer surprising to see women leaders in former “men-only” fields such as television (Marlo Thomas starring in That Girl ) and the Supreme Court (Justices Sandra Day O\\\\\\'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg) (Napikoski). In 1960, the federal government approved a birth control pill and by the end of the sixties, over 80% of wives of childbearing age were using contraception (Murray). People sat on both sides of this moral issue, but regardless, most women revelled in this new-found personal freedom. Of course, pop culture reflected the tumultuous times with such gender opinionated hits such as Lesley Gore\\\\\\'s song, “You Don\\\\\\'t Own Me” (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). Early on, women’s fashion trends were Jacqueline Kennedy influenced with elegant pillbox hats, stiletto heels, pastel suits, and full skirted gowns with low necklines and formfitting waists. However, in terms of memorable fashion, the end of this decade is owned by the hippies. Influenced by the Vietnam War, the hippie style emerged with frayed, bell-bottomed jeans, tie-dyed shirts, headbands, fringed buckskin vests, bare feet or sandals, and braless women (\"Fashion 1960-1969\"). It is often heard that there were “bra-burnings”, but that is a myth. Women actually created “freedom trash cans” where they threw away bras, girdles, hair curlers, dirty magazines, and anything else that they felt symbolized them as beauty/sex objects (\"The Women’s Movement 1960-1973\"). Feminists continued their fight against these dehumanizing ideals by protesting at the 1968 Miss America contest arguing that the pageant was sexist (especially the swimsuit portion) (\"The Women’s Movement 1960-1973\"). Betty Friedan’s, 1963 The Feminine Mystique , described women’s frustration over being expected to find fulfillment through the achievements of their husbands and children (\"Decade by Decade: 1960s\"). In 1966, the National Organization for Women was formed which sought equality for women in all areas of life (Napikoski). However, the NOW failed to include minority groups and working class women. Politically, a very exciting moment in 1960 occurred when Aboriginal women (and men) gained the right to vote (\"Decade by Decade: 1960s\")! In the US, the 1963 Equal Pay Act and the 1964 Civil Rights Act (which forbid discrimination based on sex) were signed into law (Napikoski). To be a young woman in the late sixties and early seventies was unimaginably exciting. It was yet another time where women were pioneers. On the space frontier, Valentina Tereshkova made history as the first woman in outer space (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). A team of 13 women were also secretly trained as astronauts by NASA along with 7 men (\"The Women’s Movement 1960-1973\"). Unfortunately, the program, called “Mercury 13”, was abandoned as it lacked political support. Other interesting women during this time were: Shirley Chisholm (the first African-American woman elected into the U.S. House of Representatives), Eleanor Roosevelt (a former first lady who chaired President John F. Kennedy Jr.’s Commission on the Status of Women), and Audrey Hepburn (one of the most beloved movie stars of her day who starred in classics from the 1960’s such as “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” and “My Fair Lady”) (\"Decade by Decade: 1960s\"). A woman is like a tea bag - you can\\\\\\'t tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water. ~ Eleanor Roosevelt Known as the second wave of feminism, the 1970s marked a time of change for women around the world. On August 26, 1970 - the 50th anniversary of women\\\\\\'s rights in the US - a nationwide demonstration for women’s rights, The Women’s Strike for Equality, was held. It was described by Time magazine as “the first big demonstration of the Women\\\\\\'s Liberation movement.” It was organized by the National Organization for Women (NOW) and its then-president Betty Friedan. At a NOW conference in March 1970, Betty Friedan called for the Strike for Equality, asking for women to stop working for a day to draw attention to the prevalent problem of unequal pay for women\\\\\\'s work. She organized the protest, using such slogans as \"Don\\\\\\'t Iron While the Strike is Hot!\" ( Napikoski, 2) . Women were greatly influenced by books and articles by feminists such as Kate Millett, Germaine Greer, Gloria Steinem and Shulamith Firestone, and by publications such as Women Unite: An Anthology of the Women\\\\\\'s Movement (1972) and Margaret Anderson\\\\\\'s Mother Was Not a Person (1973). In the late 60s and 70s Canadian women from Vancouver to Halifax began forming groups. Organized in 1968, The Vancouver Women\\\\\\'s Caucus published The Pedestal from 1969 to 1973. In 1969, the Montréal Women\\\\\\'s Liberation Movement was founded, the Front de libération des femmes du Québec published a feminist manifesto in 1970, and the Centre des femmes edited the first French-language radical feminist periodical, Québécoises deboutte! (1971-75). In the beginning, most were awareness groups, but many quickly turned to concrete action (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 4). They began providing abortion services, health centres, feminist magazines, militant theatre, day-care, shelters for battered women and rape crisis centres, and organizing for equal pay. In the early 1970s, the movement consisted of smaller radical groups, but the movement steadily expanded to incorporate women of diverse opinions and from all parts of Canadian society, including welfare mothers, professional, business and executive women, native women and immigrant domestic workers. It\\\\\\'s more about changing the recipe of the cake than getting an equal slice. -Kate Millett, 1971 Throughout the eighties, women all over the globe were still the main managers of the home, but there was a noticeable change…many men were right behind them with the laundry basket. The term “women’s work” was referred to less and less, and the proportion of couples in which women were the primary breadwinners rose to 3 in 10 (\"Gender Roles around the House\"). In this decade, men finally understood that their contributions to completing domestic chores directly influence their wives’ emotional health – a radical idea (\"Gender Roles around the House\")! Some men even began to be the stay-at-home parent and to take paternity leave. Shoulder pads were all the rage. Everything from the brassier upwards came with its own set and, by the end of the decade, some were the size of dinner plates! In fact, they defined fashion of the era. This now-ridiculed style trend was called “power dressing”, and people felt it gave the wearer a look of high status and position (\"Women\\\\\\'s Clothing\"). The 1980’s would continue as all others before and after it with all aspects of pop culture (i.e. music, fashion, literature etc.) reflecting the attitudes, political agendas, and belief systems of the time. Abortion was also at the forefront of this decade. Illegal and self-abortions were exceedingly common (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). Some US states a llowed abortion under certain circumstances, and it was – and still is – a political and moral hotbed. Feminists opposed so many restrictions to and the high prices of abortions (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\") . Most religious groups, however, wanted it banned. Doctors and facilities providing abortions were subjected to picketing, chemical attacks, death threats, invasions, and blockades (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\") . Feminists argued that it’s a women’s “right” to dictate what happens to her own body while opponents desperately fought for the one with no voice—the unborn child. Naturally, many political landmarks concerning women’s rights and violence against women characterized the time. In 1981, courageous women – concerned about women\\\\\\'s rights being excluded from the proposed new Charter of Rights - lobbied Members of Parliament, and consequently women\\\\\\'s rights were included in Canada\\\\\\'s constitution (Morris). No longer could bars and pubs refuse service to women. In 1982, NDP MP Margaret Mitchell was ridiculed after raising the issue of violence against women in the House of Commons. The outcry resulting was so fierce that in 1983, rape laws were broadened to sexual assault laws (Morris). Finally, it became a criminal offence for a man to rape his wife, and charges were laid in several domestic violence cases. Other monumental shifts also occurred. Women were now allowed to apply for loans and credit in their own names, retire at the same age as men, work night shifts in factories, and Aboriginal women who married non-status men were no longer forced to give up their “Indian” status (Morris). Not surprisingly, many amazing women emerged in the eighties. Sharon Wood, from Alberta, was the first Canadian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest (Morris). Christa McAuliffe, along with seven others, trained to be one of the first civilians to go into space (\"The Women\\\\\\'s Timeline\"). Sadly, this historical event was shrouded in devastation when the space shuttle Challenger exploded while the world watched, horrified. Tina Turner’s brand of rock exploded the charts as did the newly-discovered Madonna’s pop. Karen Carpenter died from complications related to an eating disorder, bringing awareness to the plight of anorexia (Morris). The Oprah Winfrey Show aired nationwide, turning Oprah into one of the most admired and watched talk show hosts in the country. And ironically…Wonder Woman becomes as popular as ever! By the mid-1990s, the generation who had grown up with the women’s movement of the 1960s and \\\\\\'70s had come of age, starting families and careers of their own. It\\\\\\'s not surprising then, that the third wave of feminism was in this decade. Some early advocates of the new approach were literally daughters of the second wave. Third Wave Direct Action Corporation (organized in 1992), which became the Third Wave Foundation in 1997, was dedicated to supporting “groups and individuals working towards gender, racial, economic, and social justice” (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2). Both were founded by (among others) Rebecca Walker, the daughter of the novelist and second-waver Alice Walker. Walker, and others like her grew up with the expectation of achievement and examples of female success, as well as an awareness of the barriers presented by sexism, racism, and classism. Third-wave feminists sought to question, reclaim, and redefine the ideas, words, and media that have transmitted ideas about womanhood, gender, beauty, sexuality, femininity, and masculinity, among other things (Encyclopedia Britannica, 3). There was a distinct shift in perceptions of gender, with the concept that there are some characteristics that are strictly male and others that are strictly female giving way to the notion of a gender continuum. From this perspective each person is seen as possessing, expressing, and suppressing the full range of traits that had previously been associated with one gender or the other. Media was a major factor in 1990s feminism. In the movie-world, teen girl audiences emerged as one of the most powerful demographic factors of the 90s, often creating surprise hits out of movies, such as the low-budget romantic comedy Clueless (1995) and the slasher parody Scream (1996). In 1997, teen girls saved the romantic epic Titanic from financial disaster when groups of them flocked to theatres for repeat viewings of it. In music, phrases such as \"Girl Power\" moved into the mainstream with the international, if short-lived, phenomenon of the Spice Girls, adored by very young girls. \"By sheer bulk,\" according to one studio executive, \"young girls are driving cultural tastes now. They\\\\\\'re amazing consumers.\" (Karlyn, 2) For the first time, girls controlled enough money to attract attention as a demographic group. Media programming for children increasingly depicted smart, independent girls and women in lead roles, including Disney heroines such as Belle (Beauty and the Beast, 1991), and Mulan (1998). It’s clear that the role of women today is in vast contrast to the woman of the 1900’s—thankfully. More and more, women are defining their roles, not having their roles dictated to them. It’s a freedom that has been slowly and painfully discovered. This hundred year study clearly revealed the emancipation of women for what it is: fascinating and humbling. Courage, strength, determination, solidarity, and endurance changed the role of women forever. It shows just how far we have come, and how far we still have to go.\\'}]'}, {'agent': 'searcher', 'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Tool's name:summary\"}, {'agent': 'searcher', 'role': 'user', 'content': \"Before WW2, women's primary social roles were largely confined to domesticity, with an emphasis on childcare, household management, and supporting their husbands.

The women's suffrage movement gained momentum, and women like Emily Carr, Mazo de la Roche, and Jane Addams became prominent figures in the arts, literature, and social reform. Despite these advances, women still faced significant barriers, including limited access to education, employment, and equal pay.

Prior to the war, most of the women that did work were from the lower working classes and many of these were minorities. There were a variety of attitudes towards women in the work force. Some thought they should only have jobs that men didn\\\\x92t want while others felt women should give up their jobs so unemployed men could have a job, especially during the Great Depression. Still others held the view that women from the middle class or above should never lower themselves to go to work. These and other viewpoints would be challenged with the United States\\\\x92 entry into World War II. With men off to fight a worldwide war across the Atlantic and the Pacific, women were called to take their place on the production line. The War Manpower Commission, a Federal Agency established to increase the manufacture of war materials, had the task of recruiting women into employment vital to the war effort. Men\\\\x92s attitude towards women in the work force was one challenge to overcome but, surprisingly, women\\\\x92s own ideas about work outside the home had to change as well. Two of the primary sources below deal with arguments to challenge these attitudes. A number of cities across the nation had a positive economic effect because of the demand for manufactured war materials. In Alabama no city felt a greater impact than did Mobile. An estimated ninety-thousand workers swarmed into the city to work in the local war factories, especially in one of the two shipyards (Gulf Shipbuilding and Alabama Dry Dock and Shipbuilding) or in the ALCOA factory. The ALCOA plant alone would produce 34% of the nation\\\\x92s aluminum, a metal necessary for the production of airplanes. Men still worked at these plants, but without the women, these plants would have never been as productive or as successful as they ultimately were. After the war, most women returned home, let go from their jobs. Their jobs, again, belonged to men. However, there were lasting effects. Women had proven that they could do the job and within a few decades, women in the workforce became a common sight. An immediate effect is often overlooked. These women had saved much of their wages since there was little to buy during the war. It was this money that helped serve as a down payment for a new home and helped launch the prosperity of the 1950s. Documents: Classroom Comments: Many of the attitudes about women in the workforce in the 1940s were quite different than they are today. Have students consider the following: Why did the government see a need to convince both men and women about the need for women in the workforce during World War II? What were some of the attitudes that men had about women working? What were some of the attitudes that women had about entering the workforce?

Roughly 6.7 million additional women went to work during the war, increasing the female labor force by almost 50 percent in a few short years. Footnote 1 A large share of these new entrants worked in previously male-dominated jobs constructing aircraft, assembling munitions, and staffing a burgeoning federal service. Manufacturing alone accounted for more than three million more female workers between 1940 and March 1944, rising from 21 to 34 percent of total female employment. The arrival of peace, however, ended the wartime boom in female employment almost as abruptly as it began. Female employment declined precipitously in the fall of 1945 and spring of 1946, returning aggregate female labor force participation (FLFP) almost to pre-war levels, as shown in Figure 1 . Sources and Notes : Data on male and female labor force participation are taken from U.S. Department of Labor (1953), Tables 2 and 3 , which compile Census and Current Population Survey figures. Total inductions are drawn from statistical tables published in Selective Service System ( 1948 ). Figure 1 Civilian Labor Supply and Military Inductions During WWII A large literature has examined how this impressive but short-lived surge of female workers shaped the post-war course of female employment, particularly for white and married women, who experienced substantial growth in labor force participation rates over the 1940s. Footnote 2 In an important contribution, Claudia Goldin ( Reference Goldin 1991 ) used a retrospective survey known as the Palmer Survey to show that women working in 1950 were more likely to have joined the labor force after the war than during it, suggesting limited direct effects of wartime employment by the end of the decade. The limited geographic scope of the Palmer Survey and its focus on married workers, however, left unclear if more comprehensive data might yield different conclusions. A series of recent papers attempts to provide a broader perspective by proxying for geographic variation in the intensity of female wartime work with state-level rates of manpower mobilization for the armed forces, arguing that women entered local labor markets to replace drafted men. This literature finds positive “shocks” to some groups of women’s labor force participation that persisted into the 1950s and beyond, as well as effects on education, intergenerational preference formation, fertility, and other outcomes (Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle Reference Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004 ; Fernandez, Fogli, and Olivetti Reference Fernandez, Fogli and Olivetti 2004 ; Goldin and Olivetti Reference Goldin 2013 ; Jaworski Reference Jaworski 2014 ; Doepke, Hazan, and Maoz Reference Doepke, Hazan and Maoz 2015 ). The purpose of this article is to assess the impacts of the WWII boom in female work directly using data on the spatial distribution of more than four million women working in war-related industries in 1943 and 1944 and the placement of women into more than ten million jobs by public employment offices over the same period. This dataset, much of which is new to the literature, allows for a richer characterization of female work during the war, including its geographic concentration and relationship to both industrial and manpower mobilization, as well as its rapid decline when peace arrived. The data also allow me to test directly whether parts of the country exposed to more female wartime work had higher levels of FLFP by 1950 and to contrast these results with similar tests that use manpower mobilization as a proxy. Three primary results emerge. First, both the data and contemporary documents show that the exigencies of war production appear to have been the primary drivers of the location and intensity of female wartime work. The allocation of military supply contracts across the country is closely related to the quantity of female workers in 1943 and 1944 across a broad set of industries. In many areas, the need for workers in critical war plants drew virtually the entire female workforce into the war effort. For example, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which was home to a number of converted military vehicle plants, more women were working in war production by the summer of 1944 than were employed in any job in 1940. Manpower mobilization, on the other hand, appears largely unrelated to female wartime employment as measured in these data. These results suggest that labor demand and active recruiting for critical war jobs was a central force behind the wartime female worker boom, rather than draft-induced local labor shortages or shocks to household income as husbands and fathers transitioned to modest military payrolls. Second, I show that despite large shocks, areas most exposed to the wartime boom in female employment did not see dramatic gains in FLFP by 1950 when compared to less exposed areas. The weak overall effect masks slightly faster growth in durable manufacturing employment and declines in jobs in non-durable goods industries like apparel and textiles, particularly for white women. The same patterns appear across multiple levels of geographic aggregation (states and local labor markets, defined later) and across multiple measures of female wartime employment intensity. The effect on durables, which was a critical driver of the wartime boom, suggests some lasting, direct effects of the war on female employment composition and supports recent parallel work in Price Fishback and Dina Shatnawi ( Reference Fishback and Shatnawi 2017 ), who use Pennsylvania data to show that demand for female manufacturing production workers boomed during the war and remained elevated afterwards relative to trends over the 1920s. Declines in non-durables may partly reflect the fact that many war industries drew female workers from existing civilian jobs, leading them to switch industries permanently at the war’s conclusion. Finally, to understand why the wartime boom did not have a larger impact in 1950, I study the sharp declines in female work in the spring of 1945 and fall of 1946. These declines appear to have been the combined result of layoffs in industries scaling back wartime production, displacement in industries that traditionally favored men or with explicit policies to rehire returning veterans, and large discrepancies in the wages and positions available to laid-off women relative to their wartime work. Detailed records from the U.S. Employment Service (USES) show sharp drops in the female share of job placements exactly when WWII veterans began to rejoin the civilian workforce. The industries that experienced the largest drops in total job placements, such as ordnance, rubber, and aircraft manufacturing, also saw the sharpest declines in female placement shares. Reductions in female labor supply, on the other hand, appear to have been a smaller factor. Women continued to apply for work in large numbers and swelled the unemployment compensation rolls in urban areas like Atlanta, Georgia; Trenton, New Jersey; and Columbus, Ohio. Moreover, changes in female application patterns at USES offices within states in 1946 are unrelated to changes in female placement shares. These results contribute to substantial literature on the role of WWII in female labor supply changes during the 1940s and after. Although the temporary surge in wartime employment was initially seen as a “watershed” moment for female workers, historians and economists in the 1980s and 1990s argued that the war had little direct impact on female employment in 1950 or after. Goldin’s ( Reference Goldin 1991 ) work, already mentioned earlier, was critical to this “revisionist” view. A series of case studies has since provided additional support and context for the view that WWII played a modest role in the growth of female employment over the 1940s. Sherrie A. Kossoudj and Laura J. Dresser ( Reference Kossoudj and Dresser 1992a , Reference Kossoudj and Dresser 1992b ), for example, examine employment records for Ford’s Willow Run bomber plant and show that many of the factory’s female workers were laid off and not recalled as the plant converted to peace-time production, despite the fact that jobs requiring similar skills existed at the converted plant. Casey B. Mulligan ( Reference Mulligan 1998 ) argues that non-pecuniary incentives were the primary driver of wartime work, perhaps explaining its exceptional and short-lived impact. This article provides an important complement to this literature by directly characterizing the sources of female wartime work’s rise and fall through the expansion and contraction of labor demand for war production, as well as by identifying effects on durables manufacturing employment in 1950. More recently, a growing literature using manpower mobilization as a proxy for female wartime work has nuanced the revisionist view, finding effects of WWII on female labor supply, education, and other outcomes. The first article to exploit this strategy was Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, and David Lyle ( Reference Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004 ), who find that women worked 1.1 more weeks on average in states with 10 percentage points higher mobilization rates. Raquel Fernandez, Alessandra Fogli, and Claudia Olivetti ( Reference Fernandez, Fogli and Olivetti 2004 ) show that higher mobilization rates are associated with differences in labor force participation for women likely to have had young children during the war, as well as the subsequent generation’s employment in 1960. Goldin and Olivetti ( Reference Goldin 2013 ) find that effects on participation are concentrated among white, married women from the top half of the education distribution, who likely worked in white-collar occupations during the war. Taylor Jaworski ( Reference Jaworski 2014 ) uses within-state variation in mobilization across time to argue that exposure to WWII decreased educational attainment among high-school aged women and reduced their later employment and earnings. Matthias Doepke, Moshe Hazan, and Yishay Maoz ( Reference Doepke, Hazan and Maoz 2015 ), meanwhile, argue that mobilization-induced labor supply increases intensified labor market competition for women who entered adulthood in the 1950s, leading them to exit the workforce and start families earlier. The results in this article provide important context for this literature. The draft process, which diverted millions of men from local civilian employment, does not appear to have drawn more women into the workforce to replace them. The weak relationship between female wartime work and mobilization makes it difficult to interpret results that use the latter as a proxy for the former. While mobilization may be associated with female wartime employment in industries not well covered in the data used here or with specific demographic groups’ employment during the war (e.g., white, married women), this is difficult to test without additional information. Interpreting several results in this literature is also complicated by the focus on a labor supply measure that changed definition between the 1940 and 1950 censuses; using alternative, consistent measures suggests that manpower mobilization is correlated with intensive margin increases in labor supply, but not increases in overall participation rates. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, I detail the new and existing data sources analyzed. I then present results on the determinants of spatial variation in female wartime employment. Next, I analyze the relationship between female wartime work, manpower mobilization, and FLFP in 1950. Finally, I analyze the mechanisms behind women’s exit from the labor force after the war. Data and Sample Construction I focus here on sources of female wartime employment and job placements data that are new to the literature and refer the reader to previous work for detailed discussions of data that have been used more extensively elsewhere. Across all datasets, an important consideration is the choice of a consistent geographic unit. Because counties are unavailable in public use census data for 1950 and beyond, I use State Economic Areas (SEAs), a grouping of counties within states with similar economic characteristics frequently used in analyses of 1940 and 1950 census data. Because information on wartime female employment is reported for metropolitan areas that straddle state borders, and thus fall into multiple SEAs, I group SEAs that overlap with the same metropolitan area into a new, single, geographic unit. Footnote 3 The results are robust to using alternative geographies, including 1990 Commuting Zones, which were constructed to proxy local labor markets in 1990, but provide good coverage of the metropolitan areas that existed in 1940 as well. Female Wartime Employment I use two separate data sources on female employment in the wartime economy. The first consists of reports from the War Manpower Commission’s (WMC) form ES-270, a regular labor force survey of employers in critical war industries and labor markets conducted by local field offices. The survey focused on critical manufacturing and ordnance industries, but also covered employment in government, transport, mining, and other sectors. Footnote 4 ES-270 reports were previously studied by William J. Collins ( Reference Collins 2001 ) in the context of fair employment laws, but have not been used to study female workers, to my knowledge. The WMC produced detailed summaries of these reports for several months between 1943 and 1945, providing point-in-time measures of female employment in metropolitan areas across the United States. The summary reports for July 1944, when total female employment was highest in the data, cover more than 14.3 million employees and 4.6 million women, 3.8 million of whom worked in manufacturing industries, and 438,000 of whom worked in government. Footnote 5 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated that 5.6 million women were employed in manufacturing in March 1944 (see Table 1 ), while the U.S. civil service commission lists 1.1 million total female employees in the federal civilian service in 1944 (U.S. Department of Labor 1953 , p. 31). This suggests that the ES-270 reports, while not comprehensive, capture a meaningful share of female employment in manufacturing and government, which were the primary drivers of the wartime female employment boom. Table 1 Shifts in Industrial Composition of Female Employment The second source consists of monthly reports on the activities of the USES, a network of public employment offices originally created before WWI and reinstated during the Great Depression to recruit men for President Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps. During the war, the USES became an important labor market clearinghouse, especially for defense-related industries. By the third quarter of 1944, seven out of ten jobs in manufacturing were filled by the USES, according to the agency (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , July 1944, p. 40). In 1944 alone, the USES filled 11.4 million jobs, including 3.8 million with women. About 6.8 million of these jobs were in manufacturing industries, with the remainder in retail and wholesale trade, transport, government, and other sectors. USES activities were detailed in monthly reports published under a variety of names as the department was transferred between agencies over the course of the war. Footnote 6 These reports typically included information on job applications and placements for women, nonwhites, and veterans, often broken down by detailed industry and occupation categories, state, or both. Alongside the job placement data, the reports provided qualitative summaries of the employment situations in a diverse set of industries ranging from airframes to department stores. The reports also contain data from several one-off studies of local labor markets. In what follows, I make use of information from a study of unemployment compensation claimants in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; and Trenton, New Jersey, in the fall of 1945. The WMC and USES datasets capture related but distinct aspects of the female employment experience during WWII. While roughly 80 percent of reported employment in the ES-270 data is in manufacturing industries, USES placements data provides broader coverage. During the war, 50 to 60 percent of placements were in manufacturing, with the remainder spread across retail and wholesale trade, services, government, and private households. The two measures remain highly correlated, however: 84 percent of the cross-state variation in total female USES placements is explained by cross-state variation in total WMC female employment in July 1944. In what follows, I consider total WMC female employment in July 1944 at the state level and in SEAs. I assign WMC employment counts to the combined SEA that contains the metropolitan area listed in the ES-270 reports. The WMC data also report employment in several “unclassified” areas that I am unable to assign to specific SEAs. These areas are excluded from the analysis. Footnote 7 Since the USES data are only available for individual states, I consider total placements from 1943–1945 at that level of aggregation. Footnote 8 Manpower Mobilization I use several sources of data on manpower mobilization. State-level data come from tables in Selective Service Administration documents, which report the total number of men registered for the draft in each state through 1 September 1945 and the number of men who enlisted or were drafted (Selective Service System 1948 ). Mobilization intensity is measured as the fraction of registered men who were drafted and enlisted, which given the broad scope of later draft registrations approximates the share of military-aged men who served. The same or similar data are used and discussed in Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle ( Reference Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004 ), Goldin and Olivetti ( Reference Goldin 2013 ), and Jaworski ( Reference Jaworski 2014 ), all of which provide additional detail on the draft process and mobilization measure. Footnote 9 To measure mobilization at the sub-state level, I use a National Archives database of about nine million individual induction records for the U.S. Army and Army Air Forces (National Archives and Records Administration 1938–1946). The data were created from the Army’s original induction “punch cards” that recorded inductees’ serial number, name, address of residence, rank, height, weight, and other information on paper index cards. In 1994, the National Archives and the Census Bureau converted more than a thousand microfilm rolls of punch card images into a digital format. Because some microfilm roles were unreadable, several blocks of known Army serial numbers are missing. Unfortunately, serial numbers began with two digits that denoted the soldier’s state of origin in clusters of three to nine states. As a result, several states are missing significant shares of total inductions reported in other documents such as Selective Service System ( 1948 ). Footnote 10 Online Appendix Figure 1 , Panel A maps measured mobilization intensity in the areas where the data provides at least 80 percent coverage of official totals, highlighting the extent of the missing data. These enlistment records also only cover members of the Army, which comprised the bulk but not totality of U.S. fighting forces. Of the 14.7 million men who served in the Armed Forces by September 1945, 70 percent served in the Army (Selective Service System 1948 ). The Army’s share was relatively consistent across states, with 41 of 49 continental states and the District of Columbia falling within 5 p.p. of the national average and no clear geographic clustering. Footnote 11 Army enlistments may thus provide a noisy but unbiased measure of total armed forces mobilization. To obtain a more comprehensive measure of manpower mobilization, I also collect data on total war deaths by county. Army and Army Air Forces data come from War Department documents hosted at the National Archives and known as the “Honor Roles of Dead and Missing” (War Department: The Adjutant Generals’ Office 1946 ). For each death, the data report either the soldier’s home upon enlistment or, if he gave no address when inducted, the address of his next-of-kin. Data for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard were added from similar lists also available at the National Archives (Department of the Navy 1946 ). If the conditional probability of being killed in action is uncorrelated with other county-level characteristics that influence the outcomes of interest, death rates can provide a noisy but unbiased measure of county-level induction rates. Online Appendix Figure 1 , Panel B shows that inductions and war deaths are indeed highly correlated in areas where inductions data provide strong coverage of known totals. I consider both induction and war death rates at the state and SEA level. In SEA analyses, I normalize by the 1940 male population aged 21 to 54, which roughly captures the population of eligible men. In state-level analyses, I normalize by total draft registrants as in the previous literature studying manpower mobilization. When studying the induction data, I restrict to states where the data captures at least 80 percent of the known totals. The results are not sensitive to similar restrictions (i.e., 70 or 90 percent), but using all inductions data likely introduces bias given the geographic clustering of states with low coverage obvious in Figure 2 , Panel A. Similar results are obtained, however, if the data are treated as missing-at-random within states and state fixed-effects are included. Sources and Notes : Panel A plots the share of women aged 14+ in the labor force among SEAs with above and below median WMC employment intensities residualized on the 1940 controls included in all regressions. Panel B plots the share of women employed in durables manufacturing for the same two groups. Results should be interpreted with caution because definitions of and the universe asked about labor force participation and industry changed across years. Until 1930 participation was defined as reporting any gainful occupation. In 1940 and after, participation meant having, seeking, or being temporarily absent from work. From 1880–1920 all those reporting gainful occupation were asked about their industry. In 1930, all individuals were asked. For 1940–1950, only those in the labor force were asked. And in 1960, those who had worked in the previous ten years but not persons with a job and not at work last week or new workers were asked. Figure 2 Pre-Trends in Effects of WMC Employment on Labor Force Outcomes Additional Data To measure the scale and geography of industrial mobilization for the war, I use measures of county-level spending on WWII military contracts from the Census Bureau’s County Data Book of 1947 (as studied by Fishback and Cullen Reference Fishback and Cullen 2013 ), sourced from Haines and Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (henceforth Haines and ICPSR Reference Haines 2010 ). This dataset lists total spending on equipment and non-equipment related supplies and facilities between June 1940 and September 1945. Spending is allocated to individual counties if the primary producing plants were located there. I use the sum of spending across all categories and normalize by the 1940 population aged 16 or older. The core data on female labor market outcomes for each state and local area come from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) samples for 1880–1970 (Ruggles, Genadek, Goeken, et al. Reference Ruggles, Genadek and Goeken 2017 ). Whenever possible, I use the 1940 complete count census to construct 1940 measures. I also use ICPSR’s State and County data books to collect additional covariates, such as the share of land devoted to agriculture in each SEA (Haines and ICPSR Reference Haines 2010 ). Results Female Wartime Employment While women worked in war-related industries and were placed into new jobs by the USES in every state across the country, wartime employment was concentrated in select areas in the West Coast, Great Lakes, and the Northeast. The top ten labor markets accounted for more than 40 percent of female WMC employment by the end of 1944, including more than a quarter million in the Chicago area and similar concentrations in Newark-Trenton and Detroit. In Oregon, California, and Washington, meanwhile, the USES placed more than three times as many women into jobs on a per capita basis during the war than in Oklahoma, Nebraska, or Montana. Of course, areas with substantial WMC employment may have also had more defense-related employment in 1940, making the growth in female employment from 1940 to 1944 more informative than the levels. To construct a growth measure, I take the difference between reported WMC female employment and the number of women working in 1940 in industries reported in the WMC data, which include mining and construction, manufacturing (for both durables and non-durables), transportation, communication and public utilities, and government. The choice of 1940 industries is the same as in Collins’ ( Reference Collins 2001 ) study of WMC data and minority employment. Since similarly sized absolute changes in employment may represent relatively small or large shocks depending on each SEA’s size and female employment level, I use the difference in the inverse hyperbolic sine of each year’s female employment as an approximation to the natural logarithm. Footnote 12 The spatial variation in female employment growth is tightly linked to where military contracts increased the need for new workers to rivet, stitch, solder, and otherwise help supply the Allied fighting forces. Online Appendix Figure 2 maps female employment changes (Panel A) and the distribution of wartime military supply contracts per capita (Panel B). Similar spatial concentrations are clearly visible in both maps, such as in the aircraft manufacturing hubs in the Pacific Northwest and the Detroit-area auto hubs. A linear fit suggests that contract spending explains roughly 30 percent of the spatial variation in war-related employment. In Table 2 , I test whether the relationship between WMC employment and military contracts holds conditional on other controls likely to affect female employment during the war. I do so by estimating the following specification: (1) ${\\\\\\\\Delta _{1940 - 44}}{\\\\\\\\rm{asinh}}\\\\\\\\left( {WM{C_s}} \\\\\\\\right) = \\\\\\\\alpha + {\\\\\\\\beta _1}{Z_s} + {\\\\\\\\beta _2} {X_s} + {\\\\\\\\varepsilon _s},$ where Δ 1940–44 WMC s is the change in the inverse hyperbolic sine of female WMC employment from 1940 to 1944, Z s is the variable of interest (e.g., wartime contracts per 1940 person aged 16 or older), and X s is a vector of 1940 characteristics of SEAs. Because the left-hand side is a difference across two time periods only, this specification is equivalent to estimating the effects of a shock (e.g., contracts) on WMC employment in a panel setting with SEA fixed effects included. Table 2 Female Wartime Employment, Contracts, and Manpower Mobilization To make coefficient sizes interpretable across specifications, I standardize the outcome and war contracts, inductions, and war deaths measures to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one. Column 1 shows that a one standard deviation increase in war contracts per capita is associated with a 0.50 standard deviation increase in female employment growth. As shown in column 2, the relationship is weakened slightly, but remains large and statistically significant after accounting for 1940 characteristics of SEAs, including the share of employment in manufacturing, white share of population, median schooling for women 25 years or older, and the female labor force participation rate. These results stand in stark contrast to the relationship between manpower mobilization and female wartime employment. Both manpower mobilization and war deaths exhibit a negative but insignificant unconditional relationship with female WMC employment growth, as shown in column 3 of Table 2 . Column 4 shows that this relationship remains similarly weak when only states with at least 80 percent coverage in enlistment data are used. Column 5 shows that the relationship is also small and insignificant after controlling for the same set of 1940 characteristics. Columns 6 and 7 show a similar pattern for war deaths. To compare these results to the previous literature, I conduct the same exercise at the state level in Table 3 , which allows me to use the same mobilization measure as in Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle ( Reference Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004 ) and others. To make comparisons across columns easier, I continue to standardize both the outcomes and explanatory variables to have a mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one. Footnote 13 The results paint a similar picture. War contracts are correlated with changes in total female employment, while inductions and war deaths exhibit an either weak or negative relationship. Table 3 State Level Relationship Between Female Wartime Employment, Contracts, and Manpower Mobilization Analyzing state-level information also allows me to make use of USES data on female placements into new jobs, which I do in Table 4 . Because no measure of 1940 female job placements is available, however, here I use total placements during the war divided by the 1940 female population aged 16 or older as the outcome of interest. Panel A shows that the state-level relationship between USES placements and contracts and mobilization follows a familiar pattern: Contracts are associated with more placements, both with and without the use of additional controls, while inductions and war deaths are not. Table 4 State Level Relationship Between Female Uses Placements, Contracts, and Manpower Mobilization USES placements also provide an opportunity to study female wartime employment in jobs not well covered in WMC data, including positions in white-collar clerical and sales jobs. Goldin and Olivetti ( Reference Goldin 2013 ), exploiting mobilization as a proxy for wartime employment, suggest that wartime white collar jobs led to persistent increases in labor force participation for women who were white, married, and more educated. In Panel B, I test the relationship between female placements in clerical and sales occupations and contracts and mobilization. While military contracts are correlated with more white-collar jobs (although the relationship is weaker than in Panel A), inductions and war deaths are not. Taken together, these results suggest that the geography of rapidly ramping-up wartime production, rather than manpower shortages due to the draft, appears to have driven female employment during the war. There are several reasons why this may be the case. First, female wartime workers were not primarily the wives of soldiers picking up new jobs to supplement meager military pay. In a BLS analysis of special questions added to a CPS survey in the spring of 1944, married women constituted 44 percent of the female workforce, but only 7.7 percent of workers had a husband absent in the armed forces (U.S. Department of Labor 1944 ). Thus, it does not appear that the bulk of female wartime workers were making up for lost income as the household’s primary earner joined the military. Second, war industries drove a disproportionate share of the female employment boom. Manufacturing industry jobs climbed from 21 percent of female employment in 1940 to 34 percent by March 1944, with many of the gains coming from ordnance, rubber products, scientific instruments, industrial electrical equipment, and telecommunications equipment essential to the war effort, as shown in Table 1 . Areas like Detroit, which was home to a large cluster of defense-related jobs, more than doubled the number of women in their labor force after active recruiting efforts by the USES and local employers (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , May 1943, p. 12). The scope of labor shortages generated by large-scale war production appears to have dominated any decreases in male labor supply caused by the carefully managed manpower mobilization process. Hence, “the industrial composition of an area largely determines the extent of [female] employment in that area,” as the USES noted in a 1943 report (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , May 1943, p. 12). Effects of Wartime Work in 1950 If the WWII employment experience had any immediate effect on female work or industry choice, one would expect areas that experienced more wartime work to have higher levels of FLFP by 1950, either overall or within specific sectors. To test this hypothesis, I employ the difference-in-difference specification from Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle ( Reference Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004 ) using the IPUMS micro samples. The primary estimating equation is: (2) ${Y_{ist}} = {\\\\\\\\alpha _s} + {\\\\\\\\beta _0}1\\\\\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {t = 1950} \\\\\\\\right\\\\\\\\} + {\\\\\\\\beta _1}WM{C_s}1\\\\\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {t = 1950} \\\\\\\\right\\\\\\\\} + {\\\\\\\\beta _2}{X_{ist}} + {\\\\\\\\beta _3}{X_{ist}}1\\\\\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {t = 1950} \\\\\\\\right\\\\\\\\} + {e_{ist}},$ where Y ist is the outcome variable for individual i in SEA s at time t (either 1940 or 1950), α s is a SEA fixed effect, WMC s is the growth in female employment in WMC industry categories from 1940 to 1944, as studied in the previous subsection, and X ist is a set of individual characteristics, such as age, state of birth, and marital status, and SEA-level controls measured as of 1940, such as median education and the white share of the population. Footnote 14 The primary coefficient of interest is β 1 , which reflects differential changes in the outcome as a result of variation in WMC s , conditional on all controls. I estimate Specification (2) on the pooled sample of IPUMS 1940 and 1950 census data for all females aged 14 to 64 and not working in farm occupations and industries. The identifying assumption in Specification (2) is not that war production was randomly assigned across SEAs. Instead, it is parallel trends: β 1 provides an unbiased estimate of the effect of WMC employment intensity on female labor force outcomes in 1950 if, absent differences in WMC s , areas that experienced relatively more wartime employment would have had similar changes in female labor force outcomes from 1940 to 1950 compared to areas that experienced relatively less. Specification (2) also interacts area characteristics such as industrial composition and educational attainment (measured in 1940) with an indicator for 1950 (captured by β 3 ). This weakens the identifying assumption by instead requiring parallel trends for SEAs with relatively more or less residual variation in WMC employment intensity after controlling for these factors. What is this source of this residual variation in WMC employment? As noted in the previous subsection, female wartime employment was primarily driven by the location and scale of war production. While much production occurred in existing manufacturing hubs and converted plants, the urgent need for war materials often transformed local labor markets well positioned to supply a critical good in unpredictable ways. For example, in Beaumont, Texas, which the USES described as the “number one boomtown of Texas” in the summer of 1943, the primary pre-war industry was oil and gas refining (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , Aug. 1943, p. 21). The war, however, transformed Beaumont’s ship building industry. The town had 2,800 workers in six shipyards in 1941 and 29,600 workers in dozens of shipyards in 1943. Women were hired in Beaumont in “ever-increasing” numbers, even in small shipyards that had been “reluctant to utilize women” (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , August 1943, p. 21). It seems unlikely that production ramped up so dramatically in Beaumont because of characteristics of the local female work force. It is this variation that Specification (2) attempts to isolate. The main results are presented in Table 5 , where the outcome variables of interest are an indicator for whether the individual reported being in the labor force and the total hours worked during the census reference week. Because labor force participation trended differently for all women, white women, and white, married women over this period, I test for effects on these three groups separately in Panels A, B, and C, respectively. As in the previous section, I normalize WMC employment intensity to have a standard deviation of one so that coefficients can be easily interpreted and compared across panels. Table 5 Impact of Wartime Work on Female Labor Force Participation In 1950 The effects in column 1 of Panel A suggest that the unconditional relationship between wartime employment and FLFP growth is very close to zero. Column 2 shows that the results are not affected by the inclusion of individual-level controls, including age, birthplace, and marital status dummies. Column 3, however, shows that after accounting for 1940 characteristics of SEAs, WMC employment appears to have had a modest positive impact on overall FLFP growth. The coefficient reported implies that a one standard deviation increase in WMC employment intensity would generate a 0.3 p.p. increase in FLFP. The results in columns 4–6 show a similar pattern and suggest small positive effects on hours worked after accounting for 1940 controls. Panel B shows that these results are driven primarily by white women. For this group, effects on both labor force participation and hours worked are positive, although only participation is statistically distinguishable from zero (p < 0.05). The coefficients reported in Panel C for white, married women are similar, although it is more difficult to detect effects due to the loss of precision. The results in Table 5 are robust to a variety of alternative specifications. Similar effects are obtained, for example, if WMC employment intensity is winsorized by replacing values above the 95th percentile with the 95th percentile, which reduces the influence of several SEAs that experienced exceptionally large employment shocks relative to their 1940 employment base, such as in the naval cluster around Hampton Roads, Virginia. Similar results are also obtained if alternative definitions of WMC employment intensity are used, including normalizing by 1940 female employment or population (instead of using the growth) and excluding all areas that reported no WMC employment. Finally, using 1990 commuting zones instead of SEAs also leads to similar results. To investigate these small effects further, in Table 6 I estimate Specification (2) with an indicator for participation in various industries and the total hours worked in each industry as the outcome variables. Each cell in the table contains the coefficients and standard error for β 1 from a separate regression. The positive effects reported earlier appear to be driven largely by the durables manufacturing industry, where similar effects are found on both participation and hours worked for all and white women. These effects, however, are partly offset by declines in the non-durables industries. Industry-level effects for white, married women are generally small and insignificant. Table 6 Sea-Level Impacts by Industry The durables manufacturing category includes many industries directly involved with war production, such as aircraft and shipbuilding, electrical machinery, and transport equipment. It seems likely that elevated participation in these industries by 1950 may be the result of wartime work. The non-durables category, meanwhile, includes many relatively female-heavy industries, such as textiles and apparel. War manufacturing industries disproportionately drew female workers from other sectors, as opposed to students and those out of the labor force: 33 percent of the sector’s workers in March 1944 were working in other industries before Pearl Harbor, compared to 24 percent for transport, communication, and public utilities and 14 percent for wholesale and retail trade (U.S. Department of Labor 1944 ). It thus appears that while wartime employment increased durables manufacturing work for white women, this was partly due to substitution from other industries. Interpreting the estimates in Tables 5 and 6 as causal requires that the parallel trends assumption discussed earlier holds. While it is not possible to test for parallel trends in counterfactual female labor force outcomes, one can test whether areas exposed to relatively more or less residual WMC employment experienced similar trends before 1940, which I do in Figure 2 . Panel A plots the raw data for the share of women in the labor force in SEAs with above and below median female WMC employment intensities residualized on the 1940 SEA characteristics included in all regressions. The two groups trend similarly both before and after the war, supporting the small overall effects reported earlier. In Panel B, I produce the same figure for the share of women reporting employment in the durables manufacturing industry (analogous figures for the four largest other industries are included in the Online Appendix). The two groups appear to display parallel trends from 1920 to 1940, although high WMC employment areas also experienced faster growth from 1900 to 1920. However, the universe of women asked about their industry changed over this period (see the notes to the figure), making it difficult to interpret the results directly. The gap between the two groups widens considerably in 1950 and 1960, before closing in 1970. The effects detected in 1950, therefore, reflect differential growth after two decades of similar trajectories. In the previous section, I showed that manpower mobilization is uncorrelated with wartime work in both WMC and USES data. However, it is possible that manpower mobilization drew women into jobs not well covered by these datasets and had independent effects on FLFP growth from 1940 to 1950, as suggested by several previous studies. To test this hypothesis, in Table 7 , I re-estimate Specification (2) using inductions and war deaths at the SEA level as the explanatory variable of interest. Unlike WMC employment intensity, however, neither inductions nor war deaths appear to predict changes in female labor force participation from 1940 to 1950, regardless of the demographic group considered. The point estimates for hours worked are positive but generally smaller than those reported for WMC employment and not statistically distinguishable for zero. Encouragingly, results for war deaths and inductions have the same sign and are impacted similarly by controls, supporting the use of the former as a proxy for the latter. Table 7 Impact of Inductions and War Deaths on Female Labor Supply In 1950 To reconcile these results with previous estimates of the effects of mobilization, I replicate the results from Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle ( Reference Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004 ) for all women. The estimating equation is identical to Specification (2), but is estimated across states and uses the state-level measure of mobilization intensity considered in the existing literature as the explanatory variable of interest. Results are reported in Table 8 . Column 1 shows that, as in Acemoglu, Autor, and Lyle ( Reference Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle 2004 ), there is a positive relationship between increases in total weeks worked. The result is weakened but remains positive and significantly different from zero at conventional confidence levels after the introduction of individual and state-level controls (column 2). Table 8 Impact of Dependent Variable Choice on Mobilization Estimates Columns 3 and 4, however, show that these results do not hold for an indicator for positive weeks worked in the last year or labor force participation during the census reference week (columns 5–6). One possible explanation for this difference is the changing definitions of the weeks worked variable between 1940 and 1950. In 1940, census enumerators asked respondents to report the number of full-time equivalent weeks worked in the reference year. A full-time equivalent week was defined as the “number of hours locally regarded as a full-time week for the given occupation” or 40 hours if the respondent was unsure. In 1950, however, enumerators counted a week in which any work was done as a whole week. This change mechanically inflates intensive labor supply measures for part-time workers. A woman working every Monday and Tuesday only, for example, would have reported roughly 10 weeks worked in 1940. This same woman would have reported 52 weeks worked in 1950. It appears that the prevalence of part-time work is also correlated with mobilization in 1940, as shown in Online Appendix Figure 3 , which plots mobilization against median weeks worked in 1940. Sources and Notes : Panel A plots female placements, total placements, and female share of placements. Panel B displays the female share of placements in three industries as well as new job applications from WWII veterans (not cumulative). Panel C presents changes from the January-March three-month average to the September-November three-month average for total placements (percent change) and share female (percentage point change in share). Circle diameter represents January-March total female placements. Regression line is weighted by January-Mach total female placements. Some labels omitted for clarity. See the Online Appendix for full data on industry declines. Figure 3 Uses Placement Patterns If mobilization is correlated with purely intensive margin increases, however, we should expect similar results using hours worked during the census reference week, which was measured consistently between 1940 and 1950. The estimates in columns 7 and 8 suggest that mobilization is correlated with intensive margin increases in hours. The estimate implies that a one standard deviation increase in mobilization rate (3.5 p.p.) would increase average hours worked by 0.37, or 4 percent of the mean. This estimate suggests some real response to mobilization along the intensive margin, although attributing this effect to wartime female employment is complicated by the weak relationship between the two, as discussed earlier. Why Did Women Stop Working? Given the scale of the WWII boom, the modest effects of wartime work on female labor force participation in 1950 might be surprising. Detailed records from the USES can help explain this result. These data reveal that just as industrial mobilization quickly drew women into the workforce, demobilization and the re-integration of veterans into civilian industries appear to have displaced them. Figure 3 Panel A shows that the aggregate female share of USES job placements rose from 32.9 percent at the end of 1942 to 37.7 in mid-1944, before declining to 28.4 percent by the end of 1945. The initial declines, however, were driven by increases in non-female placements. Total female placements remained at roughly 1943 levels before dropping precipitously in mid-1945, when WWII veteran applications and placements began to climb. These placement declines were concentrated in industries where women competed directly with veterans for jobs. Panel B shows that while the female share of placements in trade/services industries was roughly constant from mid-1945 through the start of 1946, manufacturing and government placements became increasingly male-dominated. The timing of the large declines in female placement shares in government and manufacturing jobs coincided with the return of many WWII veterans, who turned to the USES to find work. Many of these veterans had a legal right to their old jobs or received priority for new ones due to formal and informal “veteran’s preference” rules. Regular USES reports published at the time provide a remarkable narrative window into the extent of female displacement in the wake of VE Day and VJ Day. A 1946 USES report on the airframe industry, for example, notes that employment opportunities were limited “almost entirely to veterans, who receive preference in nearly all plants” (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , February 1946, p. 13). In 48 large plants with 160,000 total employees, 4,000 veterans were hired in December 1945, despite net employment declines of 2,000 jobs. Footnote 15 A similar report on the rubber tires and tubes industry, which had been roughly 20 percent female since it became critical in mid-1944, noted “women to be displaced...many employers have indicated to the USES that they expect to replace most of the women on the production line with men” (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , January 1946, p. 15). Other industries that were large wartime employers of women, such as the ordnance industry, all but disappeared in 1945. Cutbacks in the industry after VE Day and continuing with VJ Day dropped total employment in ordnance plants from 1,360,000 in March 1945 to 250,000 by September. The female employment share, meanwhile, dropped from 33 to 23 percent (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , October 1945, p. 11). Government employment also declined significantly. Federal civilian employment in February 1946 stood at roughly 2.4 million, more than half a million less than at the time of Japan’s surrender. While total employment shrank, many veterans returned to reclaim their old jobs at the end of 1945. From July 1944 to the start of 1946, 120,000 veterans had returned to federal service jobs under re-employment rights (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , February 1946, p. 17). The female share of federal jobs, meanwhile, declined from wartime peaks of 38 to 28 percent by year-end 1946 and 22 percent by 1950, slightly above the 1940 figure of 19 percent (U.S. Department of Labor 1953 ). Industries that did not cut back on female workers tended to be those that had traditionally employed women in production and those that did not see sizable cutbacks as the war wound down. A USES report from early 1946 noted that the footwear industry was in dire need of women in jobs overseeing conveyers, operating power sewing machines, and as stitchers (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , July 1946, p. 21). Men, on the other hand, were needed as shoemakers and assemblers. Even in female-heavy industries, however, wartime occupational and employment gains were often reversed. The USES noted that in the hosiery industry, where two-thirds of employees were female, some women hired to knitting and machine-fixing jobs were “bumped” as veterans returned (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , October 1946, p. 14). The patterns shown in Figure 3 Panel C are consistent with this narrative evidence. The graph plots the change in female share of placements over 1945 against the proportional change in total placements for 37 detailed industries. The diameter of the circles corresponds to total female placements in January–March 1945, indicating the industry’s relative importance to wartime female employment. The upward sloping regression line indicates that industries with the largest employment cutbacks also saw the sharpest drops in their female share of job placements. While this evidence suggests that many women were displaced by returning WWII veterans and laid off in declining industries, it is also possible that as the war wound down, many women simply withdrew from these jobs voluntarily. Several pieces of evidence suggest this is not the predominant explanation for the postwar decline in female labor supply. First, women continued to apply for jobs from the USES in large numbers. The USES received more than 660,000 new applications for work from women in the first quarter of 1946. Footnote 16 By this point, however, USES placements appear to have shifted towards veterans. The USES received 105,942 job applications from veterans in January 1945, which represented 54 percent of the application pool. It placed 77,735 veterans that same month, for 7 percent of the total. In December, the USES received 644,448 new applications from veterans (66 percent of the total) and placed 116,793 (31 percent of the total). Despite the fact that total placements declined by 65 percent over this same period, veteran placement shares increased roughly four times as much as veterans’ application shares. Consistent with veterans receiving priority in USES placements, differences in female application patterns across states do not explain differences in female placement shares, as shown in Figure 4 Panel A. Each point on this graph is a state-month combination in January-March 1946. While states with a higher female application share also had a higher female placement share on average, the coefficient on the regression line plotted is 0.549 (se: 0.141), which implies that doubling the female application share would only lead to a 50 percent higher female placement share. Figure 4 Panel B shows that changes in female application patterns are also not associated with changes in female placements within states. Each point in this figure plots the January to March 1946 change in female application share against the January to March change in female placement share for each state. The flat regression line indicates that female application changes are not correlated with shifts in female placements within states. Footnote 17 The USES explained the drops in female placements at the time by noting that “women job seekers have become more sharply limited to the types of jobs which they had held before the war” (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , January 1946, p. 5). Sources and Notes : Panel A plots each state’s female share of new applications against its female share of new placements for the three months between January and March in 1946. Panel B plots the January to March change in female application share against the January to March change in female placement share. Figure 4 Female Uses Job Applications and Placements A second piece of evidence comes from a special USES and Bureau of Employment Security study of unemployment compensation (UC) claimants in three cities in the fall of 1945. In Atlanta, Georgia; Trenton, New Jersey; and Columbus, Ohio, in October 1945 women comprised 60, 69, and 77 percent of UC claimants, respectively. The proportion of women is striking given that at their wartime peak in 1945 women comprised roughly 35 percent of the civilian labor force. Being eligible for UC required that these women did not quit voluntarily and were actively looking for work while claiming. Few employers were looking for them, however: 60 to 81 percent of jobs posted in USES offices in these cities specified “men only,” leaving two and half times as many female UC claimants as jobs open for women. The compensation offered in available jobs at USES offices represented steep wage cuts relative to UC claimants’ previous earnings, especially for women. Matching claimants with available jobs implied a 34 to 49 percent wage cut for men and 49 to 53 percent cut for women. Less than 1 percent of women in Atlanta could have been offered a job paying 90 cents an hour, while 68 percent had previously earned as much. In Columbus, 1 percent of jobs for women were offering wages of 80 cents an hour, while 77 percent of claimants had previously earned as much. The distribution of UC claimants’ previous and usual occupations relative to the mix in available jobs is also telling. The modal unemployed woman in these three cities left the home to work in a semi-skilled job during the war, but primarily faced low-paying white-collar job opportunities at its conclusion. Roughly 38–50 percent of female UC claimants listed their usual occupation as “housewife” in the three cities. 70 to 75 percent had worked in skilled or semi-skilled occupations in their last job. 50 to 60 percent of available jobs, however, were categorized as professional and managerial, clerical and sales, and service occupations. According to USES reports, the same pattern repeated itself across other labor markets both during and after the war. After an ordnance plant in St. Louis cut back employment in 1943, for example, the USES noted that “skills developed in ordnance are not generally transferable to other industries, and many of the dismissed women found new employment only by taking pay cuts. In many instances women went from rates of 85 to 90 cents per hour down to 45 to 50 cents” (War Manpower Commission 1943–1945 , June 1944, p. 12). Taken together, the USES evidence suggests that the immediate post-war labor market was not favorable to women transitioning successfully from wartime to peacetime employment, especially in jobs that offered comparable compensation to their wartime work. Conclusion WWII prompted one of the largest re-organizations of the civilian labor force in U.S. history. As the economy converted to wartime production, women became a central component of the war effort in ammunition plants, shipyards and government offices across the country. But as the war concluded, women left the workforce almost as quickly as they had entered, returning female labor force participation close to pre-war levels. In this article, I used newly digitized data on the geographic distribution of employment in war-related industries and the activities of public employment offices to argue that despite the size of this experiment in female employment, its impacts on 1950 female labor supply were small. While there are positive effects on white women’s employment in durables manufacturing, these effects are small and partially offset by declines in non-durables jobs. Other recent results arguing that areas that experienced higher rates of manpower mobilization saw larger increases in female labor force participation from 1940 to 1950 are difficult to interpret given mobilization’s weak relationship with female wartime employment. Changing definitions of census variables between 1940 and 1950 also make it difficult to interpret estimates relying on annual weeks worked measures of labor supply. Taken together, the results suggest WWII played a limited direct role in the future course of American women’s employment rates. Data from the activities of public employment offices, as well as narrative evidence on labor markets and industries at the war’s conclusion, can help make sense of this finding. Women’s exit from the labor force in 1945 and 1946 was the result of mass layoffs in war-related industries, displacement by returning veterans, and poor job opportunities relative to wartime work. Although women’s wartime employment experience was exceptional in its breadth, rewards, and novelty, this short-lived exception to prevailing norms was only made possible by the extreme circumstances of war and was abruptly ended by the arrival of peace.'}]\"}, {'agent': 'searcher', 'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Tool's name:summary\"}, {'agent': 'searcher', 'role': 'user', 'content': \"Women's participation in the workforce increased significantly during WW2, with roughly 6.7 million additional women entering the workforce, a 50% increase in the female labor force.

The nation needed to produce the planes, tanks, trucks, guns, and ammunition it needed to fight the Axis powers. The nation also put its financial and intellectual resources into creating atomic weapons. In order to coordinate the government agencies associated with building goods for the military, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the War Production Board in 1942 and the Office of War Mobilization in 1943. Both organizations oversaw the production activities of the private manufacturing industry. They also provided federal financial assistance to these factories to purchase additional machines for production, build new facilities, and expand old manufacturing ones. Companies already engaged in the defense industry expanded their activities and workforce in wartime. Other companies, such as car manufacturers, converted their production lines to manufacture goods for the military. Automakers, such as Ford and General Motors, shifted their output from cars to planes, trucks, and tanks. Throughout the war, the defense industry achieved incredible levels of output including: 2,000,000 trucks, 86,000 tanks and 297,000 aircraft. Many workers were needed in the defense industry to reach the required output levels. Large numbers of people moved across the country to take up war work. There was a noticeable shift in population as people migrated from rural to urban settings and from the south to the north to take up employment in the defense industry. A large portion of the population had experienced unemployment during the Great Depression. The increase in manufacturing jobs during the war helped greatly reduce the unemployment rate. Mechanical helper with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Millions of women were involved in the wartime work force, many of them in the defense industry. There were a variety of female war workers who gained employment in manufacturing during the war. A large number of women shifted from their pre-war employment positions, moving from secretarial or service related jobs to the production line. Other women entered the workforce for the first time. Women’s motives for taking on such work were varied. Some joined defense plants to patriotically support the country in wartime. Others joined because they had husbands, brothers, or other family members in the military and wished to help support the troops through their employment. Many took jobs in manufacturing because they needed the money. Often these jobs offered women higher wages, then they could obtain in other forms of work such as domestic service or secretarial positions. Evelyn T. Gray, Riveter and Pearlyne Smiley, Bucker, complete a section of a bomber Discrimination and segregation often accompanied the expansion of jobs in the defense industry. Some companies did not want to hired African Americans or employees rebelled against working with African Americans. To remedy the issue, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802, which banned discrimination in the job sector. Despite the regulation, discrimination in factories often continued. Many African Americans were able to obtain jobs in the defense industry. Before the war African American women often worked as domestic servants, performing a wide range of household services from cooking and cleaning to child care. By 1944, African American women in domestic service positions decreased 15.3%, while their employment in defense work increased by 11.5%. Chinese American women also found a place in the defense industry. They often faced discrimination in the job market prior to World War II. Regardless of their educational level, many Chinese American and Chinese women were unable to find work outside of their local Chinatowns. However, due to labor shortages during the war, many defense plants welcomed these women into their ranks. Companies’ views about hiring women were not all the same. Some companies were eager to employ women to replace men, who had joined the military. Other companies, such as Ford, hired women not out of interest, but out of necessity to complete the work. Society held a mixed impression of women in war work, particularly housewives. Female workers were often viewed with suspicion and urged to maintain their domestic and child care responsibilities above all others. Welders with Shipbuilding Corp, Pascagoula, MS When the war ended, the employment situation again shifted for women. Some women left employment to reestablish their homes for husbands returning from war. But many women were not given a choice about their employment and were laid-off from their jobs. These women either returned home or sought jobs in other sectors of the economy. Despite the employment of multiple ethnicities in the defense industry during the war, racism and discrimination continued after the conflict concluded. By Dr. Kelly A.

General Eisenhower felt that he could not win the war without the aid of the women in uniform. “The contribution of the women of America, whether on the farm or in the factory or in uniform, to D-Day was a sine qua non of the invasion effort.” (Ambrose, D-Day, 489) Women in uniform took office and clerical jobs in the armed forces in order to free men to fight. They also drove trucks, repaired airplanes, worked as laboratory technicians, rigged parachutes, served as radio operators, analyzed photographs, flew military aircraft across the country, test-flew newly repaired planes, and even trained anti-aircraft artillery gunners by acting as flying targets. Some women served near the front lines in the Army Nurse Corps, where 16 were killed as a result of direct enemy fire. Sixty-eight American service women were captured as POWs in the Philippines. More than 1,600 nurses were decorated for bravery under fire and meritorious service, and 565 WACs in the Pacific Theater won combat decorations. Nurses were in Normandy on D-plus-four. At the war’s end, even though a majority of women surveyed reported wanted to keep their jobs, many were forced out by men returning home and by the downturn in demand for war materials. Women veterans encountered roadblocks when they tried to take advantage of benefit programs for veterans, like the G.I. Bill. The nation that needed their help in a time of crisis, it seems, was not yet ready for the greater social equality that would slowly come in the decades to follow. The National WWII Museum recognizes the contribution that women played in the success of the Allied victory in World War II and explores that contribution in depth in its newest permanent exhibit, The Arsenal of Democracy: The Herman and George Brown Salute to the Home Front .\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'The incredible roles women undertook during WWII\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.historyskills.com/classroom/year-10/women-in-wwii/\\', \\'content\\': \\'Following the end of WWI, women’s roles in society were still largely confined to the family home. In most western countries, they were expected to fulfil the traditional responsibilities of homemaking, child-rearing, and supporting their husbands’ careers. As such, during the 1920s and 1930s, few women worked outside the home. Those who did were often limited to roles such as teaching, nursing, or secretarial work, but these jobs were typically low-paying and offered little opportunity for further career advancement. In addition, in many of these countries, women lacked the right to vote or own property independently of their husbands. For instance, British women only gained full voting rights in 1928, and in France, women did not receive the right to vote until 1944. Through the early 1930s, economic pressures during the Great Depression further restricted women’s roles in the workforce. Many governments, including the United States, encouraged women to leave their jobs to make room for unemployed men. In Germany, the Nazi regime promoted the traditional family model and discouraged women from working outside the home, except in roles that aligned with their ideology, such as motherhood and domestic service. In contrast, the Soviet Union promoted female participation in the workforce, but this was driven by ideological motives rather than a genuine belief in gender equality.\\'}, {\\'title\\': \"Women\\'s Roles during World War II\", \\'url\\': \\'https://www.womenshistory.org/resources/general/womens-roles-during-world-war-ii\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}]'}, {'agent': 'searcher', 'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Tool's name:summary\"}, {'agent': 'searcher', 'role': 'user', 'content': \"During WW2, women played significant roles in the military and defense industries.
